      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Please read these terms carefully before using our website or services</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By accessing or using this website, you agree to these Terms and to all applicable policies referenced herein (including our Privacy Policy).</p>

We do not guarantee the prevention of crime, any specific incident response times, or any particular outcomes from using our services or information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">
      <h2>3. No Offer; Services Only by Contract</h2>
      <p>Nothing on the website constitutes a binding offer to provide services. Security services are provided exclusively under a separate, mutually executed written service agreement that defines the scope of work, staffing, pricing, and each party's responsibilities and liabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">
      <h2>4. Disclaimers (As Is / As Available)</h2>
      <p>This website and all content on it are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

    <div class="terms-section">
      <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, ShieldWise Security and its owners, officers, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from your use of the site or any content herein. In any event, our total liability for any claim related to this website or its use will not exceed the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or the amount you paid (if anything) to use the site in the 12 months before the claim arose. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain liability limitations, so some of these limits may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">
      <h2>6. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ShieldWise Security and its affiliates, owners, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the site, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third party's rights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">

      <p>Our website may include links to third-party websites or integrate third-party tools or services for convenience. ShieldWise Security is not responsible for any third-party sites, content, products, or services, and your use of them is at your own risk. Linking to or using third-party sites does not imply endorsement or verification by us.</p>

    <div class="terms-section">
      <h2>12. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Arbitration & Class-Action Waiver</h2>
      <p>These Terms and your use of the site are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, and by applicable U.S. federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act). Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this website or these Terms shall be resolved by binding individual arbitration in Orange County or Los Angeles County, California, administered by a reputable arbitration provider such as JAMS or the AAA under their applicable rules.</p>
      <p><strong>No Class Actions:</strong> You and ShieldWise Security each waive the right to a trial by jury and agree that any dispute will be resolved on an individual basis, not as part of any class or representative action. An arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties.</p>
      <p><strong>Small Claims Option:</strong> Either you or ShieldWise may choose to bring an individual claim in small claims court instead of arbitration if the claim qualifies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">
      <h2>13. Severability; No Waiver</h2>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severed from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or provision.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">
      <h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>ShieldWise Security may update or modify these Terms of Service at any time in its discretion.
