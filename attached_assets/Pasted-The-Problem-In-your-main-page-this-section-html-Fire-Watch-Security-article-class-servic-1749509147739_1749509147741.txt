The Problem
In your main page, this section:
html<!-- Fire Watch Security -->
<article class="service-item mb-5" id="fire-watch-security-services">
    <!-- ... content ... -->
    <a href="/services/fire-watch" class="btn btn-primary service-link" title="Learn more about our Fire Watch Security Services">Explore Fire Watch Security</a>
</article>
The link href="/services/fire-watch" should be going to your fire watch page, but it's showing hotel security content instead.
The Solution
You need to check your routing configuration. Based on your server code at the bottom, I can see you have:
javascriptapp.use('/services/fire-watch', fireWatchRoute);
app.use('/services/hotel-security', hotelSecurityRoutes);
The issue is likely one of these:
1. Route Order Problem
Make sure your fire-watch route is defined BEFORE any catch-all routes. The order should be:
javascript// Specific routes first
app.use('/services/fire-watch', fireWatchRoute);
app.use('/services/hotel-security', hotelSecurityRoutes);
// ... other specific routes

// Catch-all routes last (if any)
2. Route Variable Naming
Check that fireWatchRoute is properly imported and points to the correct router:
javascriptconst fireWatchRoute = require('./routes/fire-watch'); // Make sure this path is correct
3. Fire Watch Router File
Verify that your routes/fire-watch.js file exists and has the correct content. It should look like:
javascriptconst express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    // Your fire watch service data here
    const serviceData = {
        // ... fire watch specific data
    };
    
    res.render('services/fire-watch', { serviceData });
});

module.exports = router;
4. Template File
Make sure you have a views/services/fire-watch.ejs template file (not just the route).
Quick Fix

Check if routes/fire-watch.js exists - if not, create it using the fire watch router code you provided
Verify the import in your main server file:
javascriptconst fireWatchRoute = require('./routes/fire-watch');

Clear any server cache and restart your server
Test the URL directly by going to /services/fire-watch in your browser
