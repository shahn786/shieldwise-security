The issue:
“Tustin” appears alone at the bottom in your screenshot, but in your HTML it’s coded as the last city-link before “All of Orange County,” which is styled differently and takes up a whole row.

Why is this happening?
It’s a CSS grid or flexbox layout issue. Your HTML is basically a list of <a> elements inside .cities-grid. The order in HTML controls how they flow. If you have an odd number of regular city-links (here, 6 cities), and your grid is styled for two or three columns per row, the last one ("Tustin") drops down by itself before the "All of Orange County" button, which likely spans all columns.

How to fix it:

1. Put "Tustin" above "All of Orange County" in your HTML
Just move the Tustin <a> before the main-link. It should look like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="cities-grid">
    <!-- Row 1 -->
    <a href="/orange-county/orange" class="city-link">
        <i class="fas fa-building"></i>
        <span>Orange</span>
    </a>
    <a href="/orange-county/garden-grove" class="city-link">
        <i class="fas fa-building"></i>
        <span>Garden Grove</span>
    </a>
    <a href="/orange-county/santa-ana" class="city-link">
        <i class="fas fa-building"></i>
        <span>Santa Ana</span>
    </a>
    <!-- Row 2 -->
    <a href="/orange-county/fullerton" class="city-link">
        <i class="fas fa-building"></i>
        <span>Fullerton</span>
    </a>
    <a href="/orange-county/irvine" class="city-link">
        <i class="fas fa-building"></i>
        <span>Irvine</span>
    </a>
    <a href="/orange-county/tustin" class="city-link">
        <i class="fas fa-building"></i>
        <span>Tustin</span>
    </a>
    <!-- Bottom: Full County -->
    <a href="/orange-county" class="city-link main-link">
        <i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i>
        <span>All of Orange County</span>
    </a>
</div>
Key:

Put all city links together

The main "All of Orange County" link comes last

2. Double-check your CSS grid layout
You probably have something like:

css
Copy
Edit
.cities-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* or 2 columns */
  gap: 1rem;
}
.city-link {
  /* city link styles */
}
.city-link.main-link {
  grid-column: 1 / -1; /* makes the main-link span the whole row */
  /* main-link styles */
}
If not, use this pattern!
This ensures that the “All of Orange County” button is always on its own row and all cities are in neat rows above.
