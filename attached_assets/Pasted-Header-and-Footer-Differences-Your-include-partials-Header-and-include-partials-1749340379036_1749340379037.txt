Header and Footer Differences
Your <%- include('../partials/Header') %> and <%- include('../partials/Footer') %> will only look/feel the same if:

The partial files themselves are identical (shared!) across all service pages

There is no extra/inline styling (or overriding CSS) that makes hotel different

There are no missing assets or broken links in the hotel directory

→ Action:

Confirm the header/footer partials are the same for ALL your services.

Open partials/Header.ejs and partials/Footer.ejs

Make sure they’re not hardcoded for a specific page or missing some classes/branding that other pages have.

Quick check:
Is your Header.ejs exactly like this across all pages?

ejs
Copy
Edit
<header class="site-header">
  <!-- nav / logo / contact / etc -->
</header>
If one page is using, for example, <header class="hotel-header"> or missing .site-header, it will break consistency.

2. Class Names Consistency
Main grid/card classes
You are using:

.apartment-features-section, .apartment-grid, .apartment-card

.service-card

.process-step, .benefit-item

.container

.hero-section, .hero-title, .hero-subtitle

These are the same classes as your commercial and hospital pages.
BUT: If your /css/apartment-security.css or custom CSS file only targets .apartment-card or .apartment-features-section, but your hotel page HTML structure is different, styles might not apply the same.

→ Action:

Inspect the live page with Chrome DevTools:

Check if the expected styles (from your CSS) are being applied.

See if your hotel page is loading a different/extra CSS file, or is missing one.

3. CSS File Import Consistency
You’re linking /css/apartment-security.css on all pages.

Are you loading any other CSS for commercial/hospital, but not hotel?
(For example: /css/commercial-security.css, /css/hospital-security.css)

→ Action:

Only load page-specific CSS if you really need to override something.

For max consistency, use the same shared CSS for all your service pages.

4. Potential Issues: Z-Index, Container Width, Global Styles
If the header/footer “look broken” or “not aligned” on hotel but fine elsewhere, check if the hotel page has extra wrapper divs, inline styles, or different margins.

Confirm you don’t have a rogue <div> or section wrapping the header or footer on just one page.

5. Other Issues (Common Mistakes)
a) Incorrect Paths in Partials
If you copy-pasted the hotel page into a subdirectory, double-check:

The path to the partial is correct:
../partials/Header not ../../partials/Header (if you move files around).

Your images and links in header/footer point to the correct paths.

b) FontAwesome Versions
You’re using FA 5.15.3 everywhere; make sure your commercial/hospital pages are not using FA 6+.

Using two different versions on different pages can cause icons to look off.

c) JavaScript Conflicts
If your header or nav is interactive, make sure you’re not missing any JS that powers it.

6. Debug Checklist
Step-by-step:
Inspect header/footer HTML output in browser.

Are they exactly the same as the working page?

Do they have the same CSS classes?

Open DevTools → Elements tab

Compare hotel page and commercial page:

Are the same CSS classes present on header/footer elements?

Are the same CSS rules being loaded?

Open DevTools → Network tab

Are all CSS/JS files loading with 200 (OK)?

No 404s for CSS/images?

Check for custom overrides

Any style tags or inline CSS just for hotel?

Remove those unless absolutely needed.

7. Fastest Fix: Shareable Header/Footer
If you want to guarantee header/footer consistency across all services:

Move all your shared header/footer HTML and styling to one shared partial.

If you need to customize just the logo or phone number per page, use EJS variables.

Example:

ejs
Copy
Edit
<!-- Header.ejs (shared) -->
<header class="site-header">
  <div class="container">
    <a href="/" class="site-logo"><img src="/img/shieldwise-logo.png" alt="ShieldWise Security"></a>
    <nav class="main-nav">
      <!-- nav links here -->
    </nav>
    <a href="tel:714-716-7430" class="site-phone">714-716-7430</a>
  </div>
</header>
ejs
Copy
Edit
<!-- Footer.ejs (shared) -->
<footer class="site-footer">
  <div class="container">
    <p>&copy; <%= new Date().getFullYear() %> ShieldWise Security. All rights reserved.</p>
  </div>
</footer>
Add any classes as needed, but do not change class names per page.

8. Visual Checklist
Hotel Page:
 .site-header present, styled

 .site-footer present, styled

 .container aligns everything

 .hero-section matches others

 All CSS/JS loads OK (200 status)

 No stray wrapper <div>s or missing classes

TL;DR Solution
Ensure header and footer partials are exactly the same across pages

Make sure ALL your pages use the same CSS and class names

Check for missing or broken CSS links, JS, or image paths

Don’t use page-specific classes or wrappers unless you have shared styles for them

If you want, send me your /partials/Header.ejs and /partials/Footer.ejs
I’ll quickly review them for you and tell you if there’s anything breaking your consistency!
Or just paste the live HTML output from browser DevTools for header/footer from both hotel and commercial, and I’ll show you exactly what to fix.
