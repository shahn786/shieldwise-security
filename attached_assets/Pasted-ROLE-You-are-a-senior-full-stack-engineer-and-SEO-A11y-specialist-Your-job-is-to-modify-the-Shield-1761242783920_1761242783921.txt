ROLE
You are a senior full-stack engineer and SEO/A11y specialist. Your job is to modify the ShieldWise Security website to be PRODUCTION-READY. The project is HTML/CSS/JS with a Node.js backend (no CMS). There are 100+ pages. Apply every change below across the codebase, then self-test and produce artifacts (reports, sitemaps, configs).

CONSTRAINTS
- Preserve brand/content; do NOT remove real copy or contact info.
- Prefer small, safe, incremental changes per file with clear commit messages.
- If a guideline conflicts with existing code, pick the more performant/secure/accessible option.
- Assume project root = PROJECT_ROOT.
- If a page is duplicated, consolidate with templates/partials.

====================================================
A) FRONT-END PERFORMANCE & RESPONSIVENESS (UI/UX)
====================================================

A1. Responsiveness & Cross-Browser Consistency
- Ensure pixel-perfect layouts at common breakpoints: 360, 414, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, 1920.
- Fix duplicated header/Menu contact info (appears twice). Keep a single authoritative block (prefer top bar or footer; not both).
- Validate on Chrome, Safari (incl. iOS), Firefox, Edge. If needed, add vendor prefixes for Flexbox/Grid (autoprefixer or fallback CSS).

A2. Navigation & Mobile Menu
- Implement a mobile hamburger menu with:
  - Touch + keyboard support (Enter/Space to toggle).
  - Focus trap when open; ESC closes; body scroll locked.
  - ARIA: button [aria-expanded], menu [role="menu"], items [role="menuitem"].
- Ensure all pages are reachable from the menu (Home, Services, Contact, etc.).
- Remove any repeated contact details inside the nav. One source of truth.

A3. Performance Optimization
- In each HTML head:
  - Inline **critical CSS** for above-the-fold content (home & top landing pages). Move remaining CSS to external files; preload if very small or defer render otherwise.
  - Add `defer` or `async` to non-critical JS. No render-blocking scripts.
  - Remove unused CSS/JS and legacy libraries not in use.
- Images:
  - Replace large JPG/PNG with **WebP** or **AVIF** equivalents at correct display size(s).
  - Add `loading="lazy"` to all non-critical images; add explicit width/height.
  - Provide `srcset/sizes` for responsive images.
- HTTP optimizations:
  - Ensure gzip/Brotli enabled (server config), long-lived cache headers for static assets, and immutable file naming (content hash) where feasible.
- Perceived speed:
  - Ensure visible loading states where actions take time (the submit “Loading” indicator must function and be consistently styled).
  - Optional: lightweight skeletons for any content that populates after load.

A4. Accessibility (A11y)
- Alt text:
  - Add descriptive `alt` to informative images; use `alt=""` on decorative images.
  - Remove “Image” placeholder alts.
- Keyboard:
  - All interactive controls operable with keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Space/Escape).
  - Maintain visible focus styles (don’t remove outlines).
  - “Skip to content” must jump to `<main id="main">` or appropriate landmark.
- Semantics/ARIA:
  - Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` landmarks.
  - Forms: explicit `<label for>` or `aria-label` for every input; associate correctly.
  - Fix heading hierarchy: exactly one H1 per page; remove duplicate H1 on Services page and any others.
- Color contrast: adjust CSS to meet WCAG AA.
- Run automated audits (Axe/WAVE/Lighthouse) and fix violations.

Deliverables:
- `reports/a11y-audit.md` with summary of fixes and remaining minor issues.
