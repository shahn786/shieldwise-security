 Critical Issues to Fix:
1. HTML Structure Problems:

Missing DOCTYPE and proper nesting: The structured data scripts are placed outside the <head> section
Duplicate content: Some CSS appears to be concatenated without proper separation
Missing closing head tag: The head section doesn't properly close before the body

2. CSS Organization Issues:

File concatenation problems: The CSS appears to be multiple files merged without proper separation
Missing responsive breakpoints: Some mobile styles may conflict
Potential specificity conflicts: Duplicate selectors could cause styling issues

3. Performance Concerns:

Large CSS file: The combined CSS is quite large and should be split for better loading
Missing critical CSS extraction: Above-the-fold styles should be inlined
Font loading inefficiency: Multiple font weights loading simultaneously

✅ What's Working Well:

Comprehensive SEO optimization with proper schema markup
Good accessibility features with ARIA labels
Modern CSS features and variables
Responsive design considerations
Professional styling approach

🔧 Recommended Fixes:
1. Fix HTML Structure:
html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">
<head>
    <!-- All meta tags here -->
    
    <!-- All structured data scripts here -->
    
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Body content -->
</body>
</html>
2. Separate CSS Files:
/css/
├── critical.css (inline in head)
├── natomas-base.css (core styles)
├── natomas-components.css (components)
├── natomas-responsive.css (media queries)
3. Optimize Font Loading:
html<link rel="preload" href="fonts/Inter-400.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="fonts/Inter-700.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
4. Add Missing Elements:

Proper error handling for JavaScript
Fallbacks for CSS features
Image optimization with proper alt tags
Loading states for dynamic content

The structure has potential but needs reorganization for production use. The SEO optimization is comprehensive, but the technical implementation needs refinement for optimal performance and maintainability.
