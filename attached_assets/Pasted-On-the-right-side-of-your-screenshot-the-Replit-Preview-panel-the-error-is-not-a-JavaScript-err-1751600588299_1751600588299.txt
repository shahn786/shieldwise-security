On the right side of your screenshot (the Replit “Preview” panel), the error is not a JavaScript error pop-up or browser console error.
Instead, it looks like the browser is literally rendering your JavaScript code as text on the page (you see your actual code right in the browser window, not a “site”).
This means the browser is not executing your JavaScript, but displaying it as if it’s a text or HTML file.

Why does this happen?
This happens when you open a .js file directly in the browser, or when your HTML <script src="..."> path is wrong and the server returns the JS file as plain text (or your JS file is routed as a web page).

In your screenshot:

You are previewing /Public/JS/video-optimization.js directly in the Replit preview window.

There is no HTML, just your raw JavaScript code as plain text.

How to Fix
1. Make sure you are previewing an actual HTML page
Do not open /Public/JS/video-optimization.js directly.

Instead, open your main page, like /index.html or /Public/index.html, or whatever is your actual HTML file.

2. Correct usage in HTML
Make sure your HTML file includes your script like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<script src="/Public/JS/video-optimization.js"></script>
or if your server is set to public as static:

html
Copy
Edit
<script src="/JS/video-optimization.js"></script>
Do not try to open the .js file directly in the browser.

3. If you want to see your site, not your JS code:
In Replit, go to the left sidebar and select an HTML file, then hit “Preview.”

Make sure your server or static settings allow you to serve HTML, not JS directly.

Quick Summary
You’re seeing your code as text because you’re previewing the .js file directly, not an HTML page.

To view your actual site, always preview an HTML file.

Your JavaScript should only be loaded and run from within a proper HTML page.

Next Steps:
Open /index.html (or main HTML) in preview.

Make sure <script src="..."></script> is pointing to your JS file correctly.

You will NOT see your code as plain text. You will see your site, and the script will run.
