✅ Social media profiles linked in schema markup


🟡 AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
Content & User Experience

⚠️ Missing actual body content - Only HTML head section provided
⚠️ No visible content analysis possible (headings, internal links, content depth)
⚠️ Image optimization unknown - Alt tags and file formats not visible

Technical Enhancements

⚠️ Analytics placeholders - GA_MEASUREMENT_ID and Clarity ID need real values
⚠️ Some image URLs reference non-WebP formats (should use .webp for better performance)
⚠️ Font loading strategy could be optimized with font-display: swap

Schema & Structured Data

⚠️ Review schema - Only 2 sample reviews, could include more diverse testimonials
⚠️ Service pricing - Some services missing specific price ranges
⚠️ FAQ content could be expanded with more specific Baldwin Park questions
