High-impact fixes (do these first)
Two H1s (dup primary heading)

You have <h1> in the hero and another <h1> in the intro. Keep one.
• Change the hero to <h2> (or keep hero as H1 and make the intro a styled <h2>).

Remove noisy/ignored meta tags

Delete: meta keywords, revisit-after, rating, expires, generator, distribution, language (duplicated), audience, category, coverage, identifier-URL. They don’t help and add bloat.

Legacy geo metas

Remove: geo.region, geo.placename, geo.position, ICBM, DC.title. Use schema + visible NAP instead.

Open Graph / Twitter copy

Drop emojis/all-caps and hype symbols in OG/Twitter titles/descriptions (hurts professionalism/E-E-A-T). Keep clean, human language.

Server headers ≠ meta

X-Frame-Options, HSTS, Permissions-Policy, Referrer-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection must be sent by the server, not via <meta http-equiv>. Remove from HTML and set in your server/proxy.

Schema: pick a primary type and trim

Using ["@type":["LocalBusiness","SecurityService","ProfessionalService"]] is noisy. Make SecurityService the primary (or LocalBusiness), not all three.

Keep aggregateRating realistic (worstRating: "1" not "4").

Avoid unverifiable “awards” unless true (risk in rich results).

If you include reviews in JSON-LD, ensure the same text appears on the page (yours does—good).

Add an @id with a fragment that matches a real DOM anchor if you reference it later (e.g., "#service").

Breadcrumb/FAQ anchors

Your Breadcrumb and FAQ JSON-LD don’t have matching DOM IDs. Add:

html
Copy
Edit
<nav id="breadcrumbs" aria-label="Breadcrumb">…</nav>
<section id="faq">…</section>
LCP: background image hero

Background images don’t get LCP priority reliably. Prefer a real <img> hero (with fetchpriority="high" and width/height) or keep CSS background but add a prominent <img> above the fold. Also avoid background-attachment: fixed on mobile—it harms scrolling and paint time.

Font loading

You preconnect + preload the Google Fonts stylesheet—good—but font-display: swap in body is ineffective (belongs in @font-face). It’s already in the Google CSS via &display=swap, so remove font-display:swap from body.

Keep only the preconnects you use (you’re using Google Fonts, so keep those; don’t add extra).

Telephone link consistency

Use E.164 everywhere: tel:+17147167430 (some places miss the +1).

Price ranges

In visible HTML your “Starting at $25–50/hour” is fine, but in schema use numeric PriceSpecification (you did) and avoid broad ranges for primary entity (priceRange:"$$" is fine).

Nice-to-have improvements
Hreflang: add en-US and x-default alternates for this URL like your other pages.

SRI: add integrity and crossorigin="anonymous" to CDN CSS/JS.

Inline NAP: show address/phone in the footer (not just schema).

Internal links in paragraphs: add 1–2 contextual links within body text to key service pages (not only cards/grids).

Vanilla JS: replace jQuery where easy (smooth scroll/FAQ) to reduce JS bytes.

Copy-paste patches
A. Clean up metas + OG

html

<!-- Remove these (noise/ignored) -->
<meta name="keywords">

<meta name="DC.title">

<!-- Keep OG/Twitter clean (example) -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Oceanside Security Guards | Beachfront Business Protection | ShieldWise Security">
<meta property="og:description" content="Professional security guard services for Oceanside’s beachfront businesses, marinas, and resorts. BSIS-licensed, 24/7, rapid response. Free quote: (714) 716-7430.">

<meta name="twitter:description" content="BSIS-licensed guards for Oceanside beachfront, marina & resort security. 24/7 with rapid response. Free quote: (714) 716-7430.">
B. Fix anchors + single H1

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Hero heading as H2 (keep only one H1 on page) -->
<h2 class="animate-fade-in">Oceanside's Premier Coastal Security Solutions</h2>

<!-- Add IDs for schema parity -->
<nav id="breadcrumbs" aria-label="Breadcrumb">…</nav>
<section class="anaheim-faq-section" id="faq">…</section>
C. Schema (make SecurityService primary, realistic ratings)

html
Copy
Edit
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"SecurityService",
  "@id":"https://shieldwisesecurity.com/california/oceanside#service",
  "name":"ShieldWise Security – Oceanside",
  "url":"https://shieldwisesecurity.com/california/oceanside",
  "image":"https://shieldwisesecurity.com/img/oceanside-security-guards-og-2025.jpg",

  "aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"4.9","reviewCount":"150","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1"}
}
</script>
D. Hero LCP tweak (optional but strong for CWV)

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Put this near top of <main> -->
<img
  src="/img/2.webp"
  alt="Oceanside beachfront businesses and marina area"
  width="1920" height="1080"
  fetchpriority="high"
  style="position:absolute; inset:0; width:100%; height:100%; object-fit:cover; z-index:-1"
/>
(Then remove background-attachment: fixed on .oceanside-hero for mobile.)

E. Tel links consistency

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="tel:+17147167430"> (714) 716-7430</a>
If you want, I can spit out a cleaned <head> block for copy-paste with all fixes applied.
