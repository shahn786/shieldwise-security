Areas for Improvement:
Content Issues:

Keyword Stuffing: The content over-optimizes for "Rancho Cordova" and "technology & business security" - appears unnatural
Thin Content: While there's a lot of text, much is repetitive and lacks depth
Generic Descriptions: Service descriptions are template-like rather than unique value propositions

Technical Concerns:

Page Speed: Multiple external CSS/JS files could be consolidated
Image Optimization: Hero images lack proper alt attributes for accessibility
Deprecated Bootstrap: Using Bootstrap 4.5.2 instead of latest version

User Experience:

Information Hierarchy: Important details buried in dense paragraphs
Call-to-Action Placement: CTAs appear multiple times but could be more strategically placed
