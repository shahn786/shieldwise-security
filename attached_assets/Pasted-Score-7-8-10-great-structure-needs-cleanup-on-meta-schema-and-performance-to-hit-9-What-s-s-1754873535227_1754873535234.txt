Score
7.8 / 10 (great structure; needs cleanup on meta, schema, and performance to hit 9+)

What’s strong
Clear local intent in title/desc + canonical.

OG/Twitter present; FAQ + Breadcrumb JSON-LD included.

Solid internal linking (“Areas We Serve”, nearby cities).

Performance hints (preconnect, preload, inline critical CSS).

Fix now (highest impact)
Title & meta description length

Current title is long; target ≤60–65 chars. Description ≤155–160.

<title>Carlsbad Security Guards | BSIS-Licensed 24/7 | ShieldWise</title>
<meta name="description" content="BSIS-licensed guards in Carlsbad for resorts, tech campuses & luxury communities. 24/7 coverage and 2-hour emergency response. Free quote: (714) 716-7430.">
One H1 only

You have two H1s (hero + intro). Make the intro one an H2.

Remove obsolete/ineffective meta

Delete: keywords, both revisit-after, rating, expires, distribution, duplicate language, ICBM, DC.title. They don’t help and add noise.

Security headers via HTML don’t work

These must be HTTP response headers, not <meta http-equiv>. Move:
Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, X-XSS-Protection to the server config.

OG type

Use a generic page type:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
JSON-LD: simplify & de-risk

Use one primary type ("SecurityService"). Don’t include AggregateRating/Review unless the same ratings/reviews are visible on the page and truly collected by you. Also worstRating must be "1", not "4".

Keep name, URL, logo/image, telephone, address, opening hours, areaServed, sameAs. Drop excessive claims (awards, memberOf, catalogs) unless you’ll maintain them.

Performance/CWV

font-display: swap inside body{} does nothing—remove it (Google Fonts URL already has display=swap).

background-attachment: fixed hurts paint on mobile; you partially disable it—good. Consider disabling under 1024px everywhere it’s used.

Drop jQuery + Popper + Bootstrap if only used for toggles/slider; replace with tiny vanilla JS to save ~100KB.

Only use modulepreload if /js/critical.js and /js/lazy-loading.js are ES modules. Otherwise use preload or defer.

Add width/height to all <img> and loading="lazy" to non-hero images.

Minor consistency

CSS import anaheim-styles.css on a Carlsbad page—rename to a neutral/shared file (or carlsbad-styles.css).

Ensure the phone link is href="tel:+17147167430".

Ensure all “area” URLs exist (no 404s).

Add visible NAP near the footer + a small embedded map; it helps local trust.

Breadcrumbs

You have schema; also render HTML breadcrumbs users can click.

Accessibility

Add aria-label to icon-only buttons/links; ensure color contrast on gradient CTAs.

Nice-to-have
Add og:updated_time when you refresh content.

Add internal links to service detail anchors (e.g., /services#executive-protection) where relevant.

Use a single JSON-LD block for the business; keep FAQPage as a separate block (that’s fine).

TL;DR
Trim the title/description, keep one H1, remove obsolete meta, move security headers to server, simplify JSON-LD (or make reviews visibly match), lighten JS, and fix minor consistency. Do these and you’ll land around 9.2–9.4 / 10. Want me to hand you a cleaned, drop-in .ejs head + minimal JSON-LD snippet for Carlsbad?
