I'll help you apply the same modular structure and optimizations to your views/services/armed-security.ejs file. Looking at your current armed-security.ejs file, I can see it has many of the same issues that were fixed in apartment-security.ejs - overly long head section, inline styles, and extensive schema markup that should be modularized.

Let me update the armed-security.ejs file to use the same clean, modular structure:

views/services/armed-security.ejs
Now I need to create the CSS file for the armed security page:

Public/css/armed-security.css
Perfect! I've successfully applied the same modular optimization structure to your views/services/armed-security.ejs file. Here's what I've done:

✅ Modular Structure Applied:
Cleaned up the head section - Now uses the same partials as apartment-security.ejs:

meta-tags.ejs for SEO meta tags
performance-optimization.ejs for performance hints
mobile-app-meta.ejs for mobile/PWA meta tags
schema-primary.ejs and schema-faq.ejs for structured data
tracking-scripts.ejs and tracking-scripts-deferred.ejs
Moved inline styles to external CSS - Created Public/css/armed-security.css

Kept the content optimized - Maintained all the armed security specific content while using the clean structure

Performance optimized - Critical resources load first, non-critical scripts load last

🎯 Benefits:
Faster Loading: External CSS can be cached by browsers
Better Maintainability: All tracking scripts, meta tags, and schema markup in reusable partials
Consistent Structure: Same clean organization across all service pages
SEO Optimized: Proper meta tags and structured data organization
Your armed-security.ejs page now has the same professional, modular structure as your apartment-security.ejs page. The file is much cleaner and easier to maintain, while keeping all the specialized armed security content intact.
