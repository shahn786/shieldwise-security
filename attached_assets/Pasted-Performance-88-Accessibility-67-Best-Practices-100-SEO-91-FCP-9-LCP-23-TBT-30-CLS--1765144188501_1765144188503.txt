Preconnected origins
preconnect hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first request for that origin is made. The following are the origins that the page preconnected to.

Unused preconnect. Only use `preconnect` for origins that the page is likely to request.
Preconnect candidates
Add preconnect hints to your most important origins, but try to use no more than 4.
No additional origins are good candidates for preconnecting
Render blocking requests
Requests are blocking the page's initial render, which may delay LCP. Deferring or inlining can move these network requests out of the critical path.FCPLCP

Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
ARIA
[aria-*] attributes do not match their roles
Each ARIA role supports a specific subset of aria-* attributes. Mismatching these invalidates the aria-* attributes. Learn how to match ARIA attributes to their roles.
Failing Elements
div#headingOne.faq-header.d-flex.align-items-center

div#headingFour.faq-header.d-flex.align-items-center
div#headingFive.faq-header.d-flex.align-items-center
These are opportunities to improve the usage of ARIA in your application which may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.

Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast.

Ensure CSP is effective against XSS attacks
A strong Content Security Policy (CSP) significantly reduces the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Learn how to use a CSP to prevent XSS
Description
Directive
Severity
Host allowlists can frequently be bypassed. Consider using CSP nonces or hashes instead, along with `'strict-dynamic'` if necessary.

High
`'unsafe-inline'` allows the execution of unsafe in-page scripts and event handlers. Consider using CSP nonces or hashes to allow scripts individually.
