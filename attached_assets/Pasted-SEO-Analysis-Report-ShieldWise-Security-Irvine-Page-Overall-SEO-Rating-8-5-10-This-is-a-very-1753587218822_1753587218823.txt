⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
Code Quality Issues (Major)

Duplicate Resource Preloads: The same preload directives are repeated 3 times
html<!-- These appear 3 times identically -->
<link rel="preload" href="/img/OC1.webp" as="image" importance="high">
<link rel="preload" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" as="style">

Inconsistent File References:

Page references "anaheim-styles.css" but this is for Irvine
Body class says "anaheim-page" instead of "irvine-page"



Content Security Policy

Very restrictive CSP might break some functionality
Consider testing all features work with current policy

Meta Keywords Tag

While comprehensive, meta keywords tag is largely ignored by modern search engines
Could be removed to reduce HTML bloat


🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
Immediate Fixes

Remove duplicate preload directives - keep only one set
Fix file naming inconsistencies:
html<!-- Change from: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/anaheim-styles.css">
<body id="top" class="anaheim-page">

<!-- To: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/irvine-styles.css">
<body id="top" class="irvine-page">

Add missing favicon links:
html<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">

Implement WebPage schema for the main content
Add more detailed opening hours for different service types
