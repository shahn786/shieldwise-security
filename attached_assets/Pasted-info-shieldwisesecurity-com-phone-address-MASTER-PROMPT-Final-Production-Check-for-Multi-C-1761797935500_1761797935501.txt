info@shieldwisesecurity.com , phone , , address , MASTER PROMPT — Final Production Check for Multi-City Security Website (California)

You are a senior full-stack web auditor and SEO engineer. Audit and make production-ready my website for a California security-guard company with hundreds of city pages. Tech stack: Node/EJS + HTML/CSS/JS. Assume pages like /california/{city}/security-guard/ (Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, etc.).

My Preferences & Branding

Use easy-to-understand class names in HTML/CSS.

Instagram icon in header (not Yelp).

Phone number hover effect in header.

Logo path: Public/Image/image1.png.

City pages should optionally include the claim: “Cheapest and best security guard in {City}, California” (keep compliant and non-deceptive; if risky, suggest compliant alternatives).

Remove any hard-coded price tables; if pricing is mentioned, label clearly as “typical market rates (not ShieldWise pricing)”.

What to Deliver (STRICT)

Produce all of the following:

Executive Summary (1 page)

Top wins, critical risks, and ETA to fix.

Prioritized Issue List

For each issue: Severity (Critical/Major/Minor), Impact, Exact file/line, How to fix, and code diff patch.

City-Page QA Matrix (table)
For a representative sample of 10 cities + template logic for the rest:

URL, H1, Title, Meta Description, H2 set, FAQ count, Word count, Schema presence (LocalBusiness, SecurityService, FAQ, Breadcrumb), NAP (Name/Address/Phone) accuracy, Internal links in/out, Canonical, Noindex/Index, Core Web Vitals estimates.

Note any duplicate or near-duplicate content.

Auto-Fix Bundle

Clean code diffs for: HTML/EJS, CSS, JS.

One refactored views/services.ejs with professional styling (remove unused CSS, remove inline CSS, centralize styles).

One /Public/JS/back-to-top.js fix (ensure button with id backToTop works on all pages).

Deploy Checklist (copy-ready)
Exact steps & commands for build, minify, image conversion, schema validation, Lighthouse run, and final smoke test.

JSON Report (/reports/final_site_audit.json)

All findings in structured form (pages, metrics, issues, fixes, status).

Technical Checks (DO ALL)
Performance & CWV

Target: LCP ≤ 1.8s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 on mobile.

Inline critical CSS per template, defer non-critical JS, remove unused CSS/JS, eliminate render-blocking, add rel=preconnect/dns-prefetch for fonts/analytics, lazy-load below-the-fold media, and compress text (Gzip/Brotli).

Convert images to WebP/AVIF (keep originals fallback) with width/height attributes and loading="lazy" decoding="async".

Generate a responsive image set (srcset/sizes) for hero and galleries.

SEO Essentials

Unique Title (50–60 chars) + Meta Description (130–160) per city, including the city name early.

Exactly one H1 per page; logical H2/H3 hierarchy.

Canonical tags (self-referential unless truly duplicate).

Internal linking: ensure each city page links to region hub and 5–8 nearby cities; add breadcrumb.

Schema (JSON-LD): Organization (site-wide), LocalBusiness + SecurityService per city (use city address/phone if available), BreadcrumbList, and FAQPage when FAQs exist.

Sitemaps: split if >50k URLs; include images.

robots.txt: block only staging/test; allow city pages.

Fix parameter duplicates (?ref=, utm_) with canonicals or rules.

Content Quality (City Pages)

800–1,300 words per city page (no boilerplate bloat).

Include service blocks (armed, unarmed, mobile patrol, fire watch, event security) with localized value props (landmarks, neighborhoods).

Location-specific testimonials or proof points if available.

Include optional tagline: “Cheapest and best security guard in {City}, California” only if compliant—otherwise propose a compliant variant (e.g., “Top-rated and budget-friendly…”).

Ensure consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) and click-to-call for phone.

Accessibility

Passes WCAG 2.2 AA basics: semantic landmarks, focus states, contrast, proper <label> and aria- on controls, descriptive alt text, skip-links.

Headings are not used for styling; no keyboard traps; all interactive elements have visible focus.

Security & Reliability

Security headers: HSTS, CSP (report-only then strict), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.

Strip secrets from client bundle; lock dependencies; run npm audit fix recommendations.

404 and 500 error pages with search and top links.

Backup & rollback plan documented.

Analytics & Tracking

Add GA4 (or privacy-safe alternative) with consent mode; redact PII.

Track: quote submissions, phone clicks, “Get a Quote” CTA, and form completion funnel.

Node/EJS & Build Hygiene

Deduplicate partials for header/footer; ensure consistent Instagram icon and phone hover.

Remove inline styles; centralize in /Public/CSS/*.css.

ESLint + Prettier; HTMLHint; Stylelint.

Production build: hashed assets, long-term caching headers, ETag.

Specific Fixes to Implement

Header/Footer Consistency

One canonical header/footer partial; ensure Instagram replaces Yelp; add phone hover style.

Back-to-Top Button

Ensure element with id backToTop exists on all pages; JS waits for DOMContentLoaded; toggles .active after pageYOffset > 300; smooth scroll behavior with window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' }).

views/services.ejs Redesign

Clean, professional layout; grid cards for services; remove unused & inline CSS; ensure mobile-first; export one minified CSS file.

Meta & Schema Generator

Create a helper that, given {city, county, phone, address}, returns: Title, Description, H1, Canonical, LocalBusiness + SecurityService JSON-LD, FAQ JSON-LD, Breadcrumb JSON-LD. Use it across all city templates.

Duplicate Detection

Identify near-duplicate city pages; propose content deltas (local stats, landmarks, service SLAs, response times, patrol patterns, crime insights with citations if possible).

Validation & Proof

Run Lighthouse (mobile & desktop): include screenshots and JSON exports; target scores ≥95 Perf, ≥95 SEO, ≥100 Best Practices, ≥100 Accessibility where feasible.

Validate structured data through Schema.org/Google Rich Results (paste validation excerpts).

List Core Web Vitals from lab + field data (if available) and the exact changes that improved them.

Provide npm scripts to reproduce:

"build:images", "lint", "build", "analyze", "report", "start:prod".

Output Format

Markdown document with sections matching “What to Deliver”.

A /patches/ folder (diffs), /reports/ folder (Lighthouse + JSON), and /public/ updated assets list.

Clear acceptance criteria checklist that I can tick off before deploy.
