What to fix first (highest ROI)
1) Correct factual claims (E-E-A-T) — HIGH

Title/description say “California’s second-largest city.” That’s incorrect. Use “San Diego County’s second-largest city.”

Why: factual errors undermine trust and can ding quality signals.

2) Remove risky AggregateRating until you have verifiable reviews — HIGH

Current block ("ratingValue":"4.9","reviewCount":"150") can trigger manual actions if not backed by on-site reviews and clear source.

Fix: delete the block, or implement Review items with visible, crawlable testimonials and a policy page describing ratings sourcing.

3) Replace outdated/low-value meta & geo tags — HIGH

Remove <meta name="keywords">, geo.*, and ICBM. They don’t help; they clutter.

Keep canonical (looks good).

4) Make LCP bulletproof — HIGH

Your hero is a CSS background, which can delay LCP. Either:

Keep the preload and add fetchpriority="high" to an actual <img> used in the hero, or

Convert hero to <img> in markup and style it with object-fit:cover.

Also add width/height to all images and decoding="async". You did this for one image—apply everywhere.

5) Fix FAQ UI/Schema parity — MEDIUM

Page has 5 FAQs; your FAQPage JSON-LD includes only 2. Either include all 5 in the JSON-LD or remove extras on-page.

JS is selecting .accordion-button, but your buttons use btn btn-link. That handler never runs—clean it up or rely solely on Bootstrap collapse.

6) Add WebSite schema with SearchAction — MEDIUM

Increases chance of sitelinks search box on branded queries.

7) LocalBusiness completeness — MEDIUM

Add openingHours, priceRange (e.g., "$" or "$$"), logo, and image. If this page serves a service area, consider serviceArea (Place/GeoShape).

8) Performance & security headers — MEDIUM

Use rel=preconnect to https://fonts.gstatic.com (keeps CLS down).

Consider self-hosting fonts or cutting to 1 family to reduce FOIT/CLS.

Your CSP allows 'unsafe-inline' for style and script. If possible, replace inline with hashed styles/scripts and drop unsafe directives.

9) OG type — LOW

og:type: business.business is uncommon unless you also provide a Facebook Business object. website is safer.

10) Minor internal linking & accessibility — LOW

Add internal links to related service detail pages (you did a couple—add 1–2 more).

Ensure every <img> has concise, scannable alt (yours are a bit long).

FAQ parity (include all 5, short answers)
Duplicate your on-page 5 Q&As inside the FAQPage JSON-LD, or reduce on-page to match your current 2 (I recommend adding all 5).

JS cleanup

Remove the custom .accordion-button handler (doesn’t match DOM) or change selector to .btn[data-toggle="collapse"].

Tiny polish (optional)
One clear <h1> only (you currently have two H1s reading “Chula Vista Security Services”). Make the hero h1, and use h2 later.

Add loading="lazy" decoding="async" width height to every <img>.

Add rel="noopener" to external links.

If you want, I can apply these changes to your EJS file directly and return a cleaned version with the schema/JS fixes baked in.
