Please go to the views/services folder and thoroughly improve the SEO meta tags and structured data in the <head> section of every file. Ensure that each file has a perfectly optimized SEO setup that meets or exceeds current best practices, including:

Unique, keyword-rich, and compelling <title> tags tailored for each service page

Descriptive and engaging <meta name="description"> tags with relevant keywords and call-to-actions

Proper use of <meta name="viewport">, charset, and compatibility tags for mobile and browser support

Carefully chosen and relevant <meta name="keywords"> tags (optional but optimized)

Semantic meta tags related to the page’s subject, classification, and AI search intent for enhanced indexing

Comprehensive Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags with images, alt texts, and dimensions for rich social sharing

Correct canonical and hreflang tags to avoid duplicate content and support multi-language (if applicable)

Structured Data (JSON-LD) schemas for LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, WebSite, and ServiceArea where applicable, fully filled out with real data

Geo tags and local business contact information for strong local SEO signals

Mobile web app meta tags for enhanced user experience on iOS and Android devices

Favicons and manifest links for full cross-device branding support

Performance optimization meta tags like preconnect, preload, dns-prefetch for fonts, CSS, and key assets

Security meta headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) for better site security

Removal of any duplicate or conflicting meta tags

Replace any placeholder verification tags with real ones or clearly comment for future updates

Ensure all images referenced in meta tags have descriptive alt attributes

Confirm the <head> is clean, valid HTML, and free from errors or redundancies

The goal is to make each service page SEO 10/10 perfect, so no further SEO improvement would be necessary. Follow the latest Google SEO guidelines, Core Web Vitals, and semantic SEO best practices.
