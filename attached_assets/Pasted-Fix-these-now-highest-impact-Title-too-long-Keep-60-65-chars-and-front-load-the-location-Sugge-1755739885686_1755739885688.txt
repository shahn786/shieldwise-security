Fix these now (highest impact)

Title too long
Keep ≤ 60–65 chars and front-load the location.
Suggested: Downtown Sacramento Security Guards | Armed & BSIS | ShieldWise

Meta description is long & repeats “government”
Target ~150–160 chars, no repetition.
Suggested:
BSIS-licensed armed & unarmed guards in Downtown Sacramento. 24/7 patrol, fire watch, corporate & event security. Fast response. Free quote: (714) 716-7430.

Multiple <h1>s
Use a single H1. Demote the second H1 to H2.

LocalBusiness schema fixes

Add "@id" and "url".

Use E.164 phone (+17147167430).

Add streetAddress (if you have one) or switch to a service-area business pattern.

Make rating numbers actual numbers (not strings) and set worstRating: 1. If ratings aren’t independently published, consider removing aggregateRating to avoid “self-serving” review issues.

Add sameAs (GBP, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Yelp).

Robots meta: remove unsupported directive
max-preview:-1 isn’t a valid directive—drop it.

Meta keywords + geo/ICBM
<meta name="keywords">, geo.*, and ICBM are ignored; remove to reduce bloat.

Hero image & LCP
Background images aren’t indexable and can hurt LCP/CLS. Prefer an <img> for the hero (or keep background but ensure you’ve got a real <img> above the fold with fetchpriority="high" and defined width/height).

Internal linking
Add contextual links to nearby pages (Midtown, Natomas, Elk Grove, Convention Center/Golden 1 event security). Improves topical authority and crawl paths.

Accessibility on FAQ
Use <button> with aria-expanded/aria-controls for toggles (helps Core Web Vitals/INP and accessibility).

Claims
Phrases like “78% reduction in property crime” and “zero security breaches” should be cited or softened; YMYL pages can be sensitive to unverifiable claims.

Ready-to-paste patches
1) Meta (title/description/robots)
<title>Downtown Sacramento Security Guards | Armed & BSIS | ShieldWise</title>
<meta name="description" content="BSIS-licensed armed & unarmed guards in Downtown Sacramento. 24/7 patrol, fire watch, corporate & event security. Fast response. Free quote: (714) 716-7430.">
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1">

2) Single H1 structure
<!-- Keep this as the ONLY H1 -->
<h1>Downtown Sacramento Security Guards — Armed & BSIS-Licensed</h1>

<!-- Change the second former H1 to H2 -->
<h2>Premium Security Guard Services in Downtown Sacramento, CA</h2>

3) Corrected LocalBusiness JSON-LD (minimal, safe)
<script type="application/ld+json">

If you keep aggregateRating, ensure:

"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":4.9,"reviewCount":187,"bestRating":5,"worstRating":1}

4) OG cleanup
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:title" content="Downtown Sacramento Security Guards | Armed & BSIS | ShieldWise">
<meta property="og:description" content="Armed & unarmed guards, patrol & fire watch. 24/7 in Downtown Sacramento. Free quote: (714) 716-7430.">

5) Hero LCP improvement (option)
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/img/sacramento.webp" imagesrcset="/img/sacramento.webp 1200w" fetchpriority="high">


Or render the hero image as:

<img src="/img/sacramento.webp" alt="Security patrol in Downtown Sacramento" width="1600" height="900" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" />

6) FAQ toggle (accessible)
<button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-what-services">
  <h3>What security services do you provide in Downtown Sacramento?</h3>
  <span class="faq-toggle" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></span>
</button>
<div id="faq-what-services" class="faq-answer" hidden>...</div>
<script>
document.querySelectorAll('.faq-question').forEach(btn=>{
  btn.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
    const expanded = btn.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';
    btn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !expanded);
    const ans = document.getElementById(btn.getAttribute('aria-controls'));
    ans.hidden = expanded;
  });
});
</script>
