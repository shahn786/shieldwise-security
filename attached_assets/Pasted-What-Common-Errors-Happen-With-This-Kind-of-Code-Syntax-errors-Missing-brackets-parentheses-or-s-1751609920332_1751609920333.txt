What Common Errors Happen With This Kind of Code?
Syntax errors: Missing brackets, parentheses, or semicolons.

DOM not ready: If you try to run code before the DOM is fully loaded.

Uncaught ReferenceError: Using variables that aren’t defined.

QuerySelectorAll returns nothing: You try to observe/query elements that don’t exist in the DOM yet.

2. What You Should Do
A. Check Your Browser Console

Open your site in preview mode.

Right-click > Inspect > Console tab (in Chrome/Edge/Firefox).

Copy the exact error message you see.
(This will help me give you a precise fix!)

B. Possible Problems in Your Code

Brackets and Curly Braces

The code you pasted looks like it might be missing the wrapping:

js
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // ...all your code...
});
Or, if you’re already inside a <script> after the page, that’s fine.

Unclosed Function

Make sure every { has a matching }.

Elements Not Found

If you have no videos, images, or FAQ sections on your page, then:

js
Copy
Edit
document.querySelectorAll('video').forEach(video => { ... });
will still run, but nothing will happen. This is not an error, just something to check.

ID Mismatch

The code references background-video12. If that element does not exist, it won’t break the code but the observer won’t do anything.

3. How to Fix Most Common Issues
Example: Properly Wrapping the Code
If your script is at the top of the page (before the elements exist), make sure it’s wrapped like this:

js
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // ...your pasted code...
});
If it’s at the bottom (right before </body>), you might not need this.

Example: Missing or Extra Brackets
Check that the number of { matches the number of }.
Your pasted code might have one unbalanced bracket at the end!

4. What You Should Do Next
Send me the exact error message you see in your browser console.

If possible, tell me where you included the script (head, bottom of body, external JS file, etc.).

If you want, upload the specific JS file that is causing the problem, or tell me the filename.

Quick Fix for Common Mistake
If you accidentally have an extra or missing bracket, you might see something like:

Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'

If so, check the start and end of your JS file for balance.

Want me to dig into your uploaded project folder and look for errors in your main JS file?
Let me know the filename or path (e.g., Public/JS/performance-optimization.js) and I can open and check it for you.
