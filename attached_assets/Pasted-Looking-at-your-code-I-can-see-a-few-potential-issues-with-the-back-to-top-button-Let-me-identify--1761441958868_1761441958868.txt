Looking at your code, I can see a few potential issues with the back-to-top button. Let me identify the problems:
Issues Found:

Script Loading Conflict: Your HTML has defer on the back-to-top.js script, but the script tries to initialize immediately multiple times, which could cause timing issues.
ID Target Mismatch: Your button links to #top but you need to ensure smooth scrolling works properly.
Multiple Initialization Attempts: The script has several initialization attempts which might be conflicting.
CSS File Path: Make sure /css/back-to.css (not back-to-top.css) is correct.

Here's the Fixed Version:Fixed back-to-top.jsCode /**
 * Back to Top Button Functionality
 * Fixed version - single initialization
 */

(function() {
    'use strict';
    
    // Initialize Back to Top Button
    function initBackToTop() {
        const backToTopButton = document.getElementById('baKey Changes Made:

Wrapped in IIFE: Used an Immediately Invoked Function Expression to avoid global scope pollution
Single Initialization: Removed multiple initialization attempts that were causing conflicts
Early Return: If button not found, script returns gracefully
Passive Event Listener: Added { passive: true } to scroll listener for better performance
Cleaner Logic: Simplified the initialization flow

Additional Troubleshooting Steps:
Check these in your browser console (F12):

Do you see the console log "Back to top button initialized"?
Any JavaScript errors showing?
Is the button element actually in the DOM? Run: document.getElementById('backToTop')

Verify your HTML button is correct:
html<a href="#top" id="backToTop" class="back-to-top" aria-label="Back to top">
    <i class="fas fa-arrow-up"></i>
</a>
Check CSS is loading:
Open DevTools → Network tab → Look for back-to.css with status 200
If it's still not working after implementing this fix, please share:

Any console errors you see
What happens when you click the button
Does the button appear when you scroll down?
