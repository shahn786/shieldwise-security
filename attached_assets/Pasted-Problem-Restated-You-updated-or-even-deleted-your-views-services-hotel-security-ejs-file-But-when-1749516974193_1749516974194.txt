Problem Restated
You updated or even deleted your views/services/hotel-security.ejs file.
But when you visit /services/hotel-security in your browser, you still see the old (cached) version of the hotel security page, not the new/updated one.
Root Causes (Based on Your Situation & Code):
Browser or Proxy Cache:
Even though your code sets aggressive cache-busting headers, sometimes browsers, proxies, or CDNs (like Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify) can serve cached pages.

Multiple Template Locations:
If your project has multiple views folders or you have a misconfigured views path, Express might be loading a different hotel-security.ejs than the one you think.

Server Not Restarted:
If you didn’t fully restart your Node.js server after changing/deleting the EJS file, the server might still use the old file.

View Engine or File Case Sensitivity:
On some systems (especially Linux), file names are case sensitive.
Example: hotel-security.ejs vs Hotel-Security.ejs.

Wrong Route Handler:
If you have a router or route leftover from before, it might render a different template or static file.

Step-by-Step Fix
1. HARD REFRESH YOUR BROWSER
On Windows: Ctrl + F5
On Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
Or open in Chrome’s Incognito/Private mode.
2. CHECK YOUR VIEWS FOLDER
Make sure you have only one views/services/hotel-security.ejs file.
Delete all other possible copies (old backups, wrong directories, etc).
Double-check the spelling and casing.
3. VERIFY YOUR EXPRESS VIEW PATH
Check this part in your server code:

js
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"));
You should only set the views path ONCE.
If you have multiple app.set("views", ...), remove or consolidate them.

4. RESTART YOUR NODE SERVER
Stop your server (Ctrl+C in your terminal)
Start it again: node index.js or npm start or however you usually start it.
5. CHECK YOUR ROUTE HANDLER
Since you are using a direct route handler for /services/hotel-security, make sure it’s not calling res.sendFile or serving a static HTML file by mistake. You want only:

js
res.render('services/hotel-security', { serviceData, ... });
6. DEBUG: ADD A UNIQUE MARKER TO EJS
Add a test comment or some unique text to your EJS file, for example:

EJS
<!-- TEST MARKER 2025-06-10 -->
Now reload the page and View Source in your browser. If you do NOT see this marker, it means the file being rendered is NOT the file you are editing.

7. CHECK FOR STATIC FILE CONFLICTS
If you have a file at public/services/hotel-security.html, Express’ static middleware might serve it instead of rendering your EJS.
Delete any static file with that name.

8. CHECK FOR CDN OR HOSTING CACHE
If you are using a cloud server (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.), clear the cache from their dashboard, or deploy fresh.

Quick Checklist
 Only one views/services/hotel-security.ejs in your project.
 No static public/services/hotel-security.html file exists.
 You restarted your server.
 You added a unique marker to your EJS file and confirmed it renders.
 No duplicate/misplaced app.set("views", ...) statement.
 No router or leftover code that could override your handler.
 No CDN or host is serving old content.
