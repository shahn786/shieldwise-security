This error means you're trying to render a partial template (layout.ejs) that expects a variable called content, but that variable was never passed to the template. In EJS, variables must be explicitly provided when rendering.

Detailed Explanation:
In your template layout.ejs at line 33, you have:

ejs
Copy
Edit
<%- content %>
But the variable content isn't defined when calling this partial.

How to fix this:
You need to pass the content variable explicitly from the controller or route where you render your EJS template:

Correct Usage Example (Express.js):
If you're rendering with Express.js, your route should look something like this:

js
Copy
Edit
app.get('/services', (req, res) => {
  res.render('services', {
    content: '<h1>Our Security Services</h1><p>Details here...</p>'
  });
});
Then, in services.ejs:

ejs
Copy
Edit
<%- include('./Partials/layout', { content: content }) %>
Or if your services.ejs is intended to fill the content, do it like this:

services.ejs:

ejs
Copy
Edit
<%- include('./Partials/layout', { content: `
  <h1>Our Security Services</h1>
  <p>Details about services here...</p>
` }) %>
Recommended Approach (Common Practice):
Usually, developers define their layouts to dynamically render the body content by placing an EJS placeholder. Here's a clear pattern:

layout.ejs:

ejs
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>My Site</title>
</head>
<body>
  <%- body %>
</body>
</html>
Then, in your specific page (services.ejs):

ejs
Copy
Edit
<% layout('./Partials/layout') %>
<h1>Security Services</h1>
<p>Your content here...</p>
For this to work, install and configure express-ejs-layouts package, which is widely used:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install express-ejs-layouts
And configure in Express:

js
Copy
Edit
const expressLayouts = require('express-ejs-layouts');
app.use(expressLayouts);
Express will automatically place your page content into the <%- body %> placeholder.

Summary of the Solution:
The error is caused by a missing content variable.

Pass the content explicitly or use express-ejs-layouts for automatic handling.

Applying these changes will resolve your issue.
