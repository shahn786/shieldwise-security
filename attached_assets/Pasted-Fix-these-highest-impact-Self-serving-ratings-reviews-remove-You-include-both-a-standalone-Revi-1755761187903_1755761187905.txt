Fix these (highest impact)

Self-serving ratings/reviews → remove
You include both a standalone Review block and an aggregateRating in LocalBusiness. Google can ignore or downrank self-serving reviews.
Action: remove the Review block and the aggregateRating unless sourced from an independent site you don’t control.

Service schema pricing is invalid
"priceRange": "$28-85/hour" isn’t valid for Offer.
Action: use UnitPriceSpecification with min/max prices:

"offers": {
  "@type": "Offer",
  "priceSpecification": {
    "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "minPrice": 28,
    "maxPrice": 85,
    "unitText": "hour"
  },
  "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
}


NAP completeness + E.164 phone
JSON-LD phone is "7147167430" (missing +1), and address lacks a street. Also, Natomas is a neighborhood; use Sacramento for addressLocality.
Action: use:

"telephone": "+17147167430",
"address": {
  "@type": "PostalAddress",
  "streetAddress": "1234 Example St",
  "addressLocality": "Sacramento",
  "addressRegion": "CA",
  "postalCode": "95833",
  "addressCountry": "US"
}


Add:

"sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/...", "https://www.instagram.com/...", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/..."],
"hasMap": "https://maps.google.com/?q=Natomas+Sacramento"


jQuery load order risk
You load jQuery Slim with defer but run $(document).ready() in an inline script. Inline may execute before deferred jQuery → $ undefined.
Action (pick one):

Remove defer from jQuery, or

Move the inline script to an external file that loads after jQuery, or

Rewrite to vanilla DOMContentLoaded (recommended) and drop jQuery/Popper/Bootstrap JS if not used.

Template footprint / CSS weight
body.anaheim-page and anaheim-* classes on a Natomas page + 3 custom CSS files + Bootstrap.
Action: rename to natomas-*, merge/purge CSS, or ship a reduced Bootstrap build.

Breadcrumbs only in JSON-LD
Great for rich results, but no visible breadcrumbs.
Action: add a simple visible breadcrumb nav (also helps internal linking).

Consistency of phone format
Keep visible numbers formatted the same across page (e.g., (714) 716-7430) while tel: uses tel:+17147167430.

Missed preconnects
You preload Google Fonts but don’t preconnect to fonts.googleapis.com / fonts.gstatic.com.
Action: add:

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>


Hero background not crawlable
CSS background images aren’t “seen.”
Action: include a visually-hidden <img> near the hero with descriptive alt, explicit width/height, and fetchpriority="high" (you did this on a prior page—do it here too).

Copy-paste JSON-LD (safe baseline)

LocalBusiness/SecurityService (replace placeholders):

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": ["LocalBusiness","SecurityService"],
  "name": "ShieldWise Security — Natomas",

  "hasMap": "https://maps.google.com/?q=Natomas+Sacramento"
}

Service (fixed pricing):

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "name": "Armed Security Guard Services",
  "provider": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "ShieldWise Security" },
  "areaServed": "Natomas, Sacramento, CA",
  "description": "Professional armed security guards for Natomas businesses and residential facilities.",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "priceSpecification": {
      "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
      "priceCurrency": "USD",
      "minPrice": 28,
      "maxPrice": 85,
      "unitText": "hour"
    },
    "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
  }
}
</script>


Remove the standalone Review block and any aggregateRating unless it references third-party sources.

Extra quick wins

Lazy-load all noncritical images (loading="lazy") and set width/height to reduce CLS.

Internal links: add links to related Sacramento pages (Downtown, Midtown, West Sacramento) inside relevant sections (you already did some; add 1–2 more contextual links).

E-E-A-T: add visible BSIS license #, insurance proof statement, and a short case study for a Natomas client (even redacted).

Drop unused JS: if you don’t use Bootstrap components, remove jQuery/Popper/Bootstrap JS.
