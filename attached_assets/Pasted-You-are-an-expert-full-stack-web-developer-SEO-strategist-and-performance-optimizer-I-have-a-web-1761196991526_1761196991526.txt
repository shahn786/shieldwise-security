You are an expert full-stack web developer, SEO strategist, and performance optimizer.
I have a website that I want to make 100% production-ready and rank highly across Google, Bing, and AI search.
Review my entire project (HTML, CSS, JS, images, and videos) and make the following improvements:

1. SEO Optimization

Add perfect meta titles and descriptions for every page (based on content).

Improve heading structure (H1–H3) for keyword relevance and readability.

Implement canonical tags, Open Graph, and Twitter meta tags.

Add schema markup (LocalBusiness, Organization, Article, FAQ, etc.).

Optimize for both traditional and AI search (Google SGE, Perplexity, Bing Copilot).

Suggest target keywords, alt tags, and internal linking improvements.

2. Performance & Core Web Vitals

Optimize images (convert to WebP, lazy-load, responsive sizing).

Compress and minify CSS, JS, and HTML files.

Add preload/preconnect for fonts, icons, and scripts.

Audit and remove unused CSS/JS.

Improve page speed and Lighthouse score to 90+ on both mobile and desktop.

3. Visual & Media Enhancement

Suggest or generate high-quality, royalty-free images and videos that fit my website’s theme.

Adjust layout and spacing for a clean, modern, professional look.

Ensure consistent color palette and typography.

Improve contrast and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance).

4. Technical & Security Setup

Add a sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

Ensure all internal links use HTTPS and correct relative paths.

Add proper favicon and social sharing preview.

Recommend or implement security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.).

Prepare for smooth deployment to my hosting (Vercel, Netlify, or VPS).

5. AI-Assisted Enhancements

Suggest content rewrites that sound natural, trustworthy, and SEO-rich.

Add relevant structured data for AI discovery.

Recommend keyword clustering and topic coverage for authority building.

After reviewing everything, provide:

A list of specific fixes (with file names and reasons).

The optimized code snippets or replacements.

A final report on SEO, performance, accessibility, and best practices.

Goal: Make my website look professional, rank higher, load faster, and meet 2025 AI-SEO standards.
