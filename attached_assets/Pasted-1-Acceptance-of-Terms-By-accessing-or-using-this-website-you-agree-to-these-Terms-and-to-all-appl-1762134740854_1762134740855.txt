We do not guarantee the prevention of crime, any specific incident response times, or any particular outcomes from using our services or information.

3. No Offer; Services Only by Contract. Nothing on the website constitutes a binding offer to provide services. Security services are provided exclusively under a separate, mutually executed written service agreement that defines the scope of work, staffing, pricing, and each party’s responsibilities and liabilities.

4. Disclaimers (As Is / As Available). This website and all content on it are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. ShieldWise Security disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non-infringement.

5. Limitation of Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by law, ShieldWise Security and its owners, officers, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from your use of the site or any content herein. In any event, our total liability for any claim related to this website or its use will not exceed the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or the amount you paid (if anything) to use the site in the 12 months before the claim arose. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain liability limitations, so some of these limits may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law.

6. Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ShieldWise Security and its affiliates, owners, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the site, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third party’s rights.

7. User Submissions & Testimonials. If you submit any reviews, comments, questions, or other content through our site (including testimonials or feedback), you grant ShieldWise Security a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, reproduce, modify, and publish such content for our business purposes (for example, in marketing or on the website). Any personal data in your submissions will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Testimonials on the site reflect individual experiences and do not guarantee that others will achieve the same results.

8. Third-Party Links & Tools. Our website may include links to third-party websites or integrate third-party tools or services for convenience. ShieldWise Security is not responsible for any third-party sites, content, products, or services, and your use of them is at your own risk.

12. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Arbitration & Class-Action Waiver. These Terms and your use of the site are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, and by applicable U.S. federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act). Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this website or these Terms shall be resolved by binding individual arbitration in Orange County or Los Angeles County, California, administered by a reputable arbitration provider such as JAMS or the AAA under their applicable rules. No Class Actions: You and ShieldWise Security each waive the right to a trial by jury and agree that any dispute will be resolved on an individual basis, not as part of any class or representative action. An arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties. Small Claims Option: Either you or ShieldWise may choose to bring an individual claim in small claims court instead of arbitration if the claim qualifies.

13. Severability; No Waiver. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severed from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or provision.

14. Changes to Terms. ShieldWise Security may update or modify these Terms of Service at any time in its discretion. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this document. Your continued use of the site after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms.
