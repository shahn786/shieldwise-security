High-impact fixes (prioritized)

Remove duplicate/ambiguous microdata on <html>

You’re declaring itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness" on the <html> element and providing JSON-LD for LocalBusiness. Mixed/duplicate markup can cause conflicts.

Fix: remove itemscope itemtype from <html>.

Make NAP visibly crawlable on the page (not just in JSON-LD)

Your phone is visible, but the full address isn’t. For local SEO/E-E-A-T, render a footer NAP block with the same address/phone as schema.

Fix (example):

<address class="footer-nap">
  ShieldWise Security — Natomas<br>
  2750 Gateway Oaks Dr, Sacramento, CA 95833<br>
  <a href="tel:+17147167430">(714) 716-7430</a>
</address>


Verify/replace placeholder claims & identifiers

“BSIS License #PPO-12345”, “4.9/5 from 187 reviews”, “no reported breaches”, case-study stats: these are powerful for conversion, but risky if not verifiable. Inaccurate claims can trigger trust issues and manual reviews.

Fix: use the real BSIS number and cite the review source (no Review schema—Google disallows self-serving reviews for LocalBusiness). Consider linking to the 3P profile.

Consolidate and load CSS more efficiently

4 CSS files (style.css, style456.css, natomas-styles.css + Bootstrap) create extra requests. The media="print" onload trick can cause FOUC and complicate render paths.

Fix: merge your custom CSS into one file, preload critical CSS or inline the above-the-fold rules, then load the rest normally.

Also: consider self-hosting Bootstrap to reduce third-party latency + ensure SRI.

Improve LCP reliability of the hero

LCP is likely the background image in .anaheim-hero. Backgrounds aren’t great for LCP measurement and can shift CLS if heights aren’t fixed.

Fix: Use an <img> or <picture> element in the hero with explicit width/height + priority loading, or ensure the hero has a fixed min-height to avoid CLS. Keep the existing preload but add an actual element the browser can mark as LCP.

Tighten JSON-LD details

hasMap should point to a map of your business location, not the general Natomas area.

openingHoursSpecification: consider using an array with separate entries or keep single object but ensure it mirrors the visible 24/7 claim.

Add "serviceType": "Security guard services" to the Service node for clarity.

Example adjustments:

{
  "@type":"Service",
  "serviceType":"Security guard services",
  "areaServed":"Natomas, Sacramento, CA"
}

{
  "@type":"LocalBusiness",
  "hasMap":"https://maps.google.com/?q=2750+Gateway+Oaks+Dr+Sacramento+CA+95833"
}


Breadcrumbs: align URLs and trailing slashes

Your canonical has no trailing slash. Ensure all breadcrumb item URLs match that convention site-wide to avoid mixed signals.

Preload fonts correctly (minor)

You’re preloading the Google Fonts CSS, which is fine, but consider preloading the font files (WOFF2) with crossorigin for maximum benefit, or self-host Inter to eliminate third-party hops.

Add Website + SearchAction schema (site-wide enhancement)

Helpful for branded SERPs and sitelinks search box:

{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"WebSite",
  "url":"https://shieldwisesecurity.com/",
  "potentialAction":{
    "@type":"SearchAction",
    "target":"https://shieldwisesecurity.com/search?q={search_term_string}",
    "query-input":"required name=search_term_string"
  }
}


Reduce inline styles and move to CSS

Inline styles in hero/CTA sections hurt maintainability and can bloat HTML. Moving them to your CSS also reduces diff noise across city pages.

Smaller polish items (nice-to-have)

Drop X-UA-Compatible (IE-edge) — obsolete.

format-detection=telephone=yes is fine; also ensure every phone instance uses tel: (you did).

jQuery slim + Bootstrap 4.5: if you rely on AJAX anywhere, slim omits it. If not, you’re fine; otherwise switch to full jQuery or upgrade to a modern stack.

Hreflang: if you’ll have Spanish versions (common for CA), add proper hreflang alternates.

Security headers: not SEO, but helps CWV/qual—add CSP, COEP/COOP, Permissions-Policy server-side.

Validity sanity checks (to run before deploying)

Test JSON-LD with Google Rich Results + Schema.org validators.

Lighthouse (mobile): check LCP (<2.5s), CLS (<0.1), make sure the hero is recognized as LCP.

Verify the BSIS license number and review counts are accurate and consistent across the site and 3P profiles.

Visible NAP block in footer (match schema)

<footer>
  <address class="footer-nap" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/PostalAddress">
    <strong>ShieldWise Security — Natomas</strong><br>
    <span itemprop="streetAddress">2750 Gateway Oaks Dr</span>,
    <span itemprop="addressLocality">Sacramento</span>,
    <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">95833</span><br>
    <a href="tel:+17147167430">(714) 716-7430</a>
  </address>
</footer>


Hero LCP (swap background for element)

<picture class="hero-media">
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/sacramento.webp" />
  <img src="/img/sacramento.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" fetchpriority="high" />
</picture>


(Then apply the gradient with CSS over the <picture>.)
