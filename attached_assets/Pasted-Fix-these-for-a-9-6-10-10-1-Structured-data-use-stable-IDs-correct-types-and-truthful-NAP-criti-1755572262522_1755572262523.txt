Fix these for a 9.6–10/10
1) Structured data: use stable IDs, correct types, and truthful NAP (critical)

Your Service.provider references #organization, but the Organization node doesn’t define an @id. Add one and reference it.

Prefer @type: ["LocalBusiness","SecurityService","Organization"] (or at least ["LocalBusiness","SecurityService"]) to reflect a security guard company.

Replace the placeholder street (“456 Main St”) with your real business address (or omit address if you truly operate statewide/virtual). Inconsistent NAP hurts local rankings.

Add hasOfferCatalog or makesOffer (Offer) for key services, and areaServed per city as you did—good!

If you show reviews on page, add AggregateRating (only if verifiable).

2) Hreflang consistency (medium)

You declare og:locale:alternate = es_US but there’s no Spanish hreflang. Either add:

<link rel="alternate" hreflang="es-US" href="https://shieldwisesecurity.com/es/ventura-county" />


…or remove the OG alternate until the Spanish page exists.

3) Fonts & preconnect (small but measurable)

You preconnect to fonts.gstatic.com but load CSS from fonts.googleapis.com. Add:

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" crossorigin>


Consider display=swap (already present) + self-hosting fonts for best CLS/LCP.

4) CWV/lazy-loading & CLS hardening (medium)

Add loading="lazy" to non-hero images (service icons/images when applicable).

Define explicit width/height (or aspect-ratio) for any raster images (logo, future inline images) to reduce CLS.

For Font Awesome icons, consider an inline SVG set to avoid FOIT/FOUT; or preload FA CSS.

5) E-E-A-T / Local proof (high for YMYL services)

Add a licensing badge and license number in body (you do), and mirror it in schema ("hasCredential" on Organization, optional).

Link to a real GMB/GBP Place URL (the current Google Maps link looks generic). Use your exact place URL.

Add Case Studies/Clients (even short) and team/management snippets; link them internally.

6) Minor metadata polish (nice-to-have)

Add manifest.json since you declare PWA meta:

<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">


Add og:image:secure_url (same URL via https), and twitter:site only if that handle exists.

Ensure canonical path matches route normalization (with/without trailing slash).

7) Internal linking & anchors (quick wins)

Add breadcrumbs visibly on page (not only JSON-LD).

From city cards, link to unique city pages with target keywords already (you do—good). Ensure each target page has reciprocal links back to Ventura County pillar where relevant.
