Issues hurting you (fix these first)

NAP/Location inconsistencies

Street: 2750 Gateway Oaks Dr is Sacramento, not Elk Grove, but your locality is set to “Elk Grove.”

Hero uses /img/sacramento.webp on an Elk Grove page.
Impact: Local pack trust + E-E-A-T signals can drop due to mismatched location signals.

Schema correctness

aggregateRating.worstRating is "4" (should be "1").

Review JSON-LD (“Jennifer Martinez…”) must reflect a visible on-page review with the same text; otherwise remove or convert to AggregateRating only.

Service.offers.priceRange is non-standard inside Offer; prefer priceSpecification or move a simple priceRange to the business entity.

Deprecated/low-value metas

<meta name="keywords">, geo.*, ICBM — ignored by Google; can be removed to reduce noise.

Over-optimized / repetitive phrasing

Repetition like “residential & family security, residential, education…” in description and body looks keyword-stuffed. Tighten phrasing.

Multiple CSS files

/css/style.css, /css/style456.css, /css/anaheim-styles.css + Bootstrap → increase CSS weight & FCP/CLS risk. Consolidate and inline above-the-fold critical CSS.

Potential social handle mismatch

@ShieldWiseSec—ensure it exists and matches brand; otherwise remove.

Quick-win fixes (copy/paste ready)
1) Clean up metas (remove noise, fix hero)
<!-- Replace hero preload with the correct city image -->
<link rel="preload" href="/img/elk-grove-hero.webp" as="image" fetchpriority="high">
<!-- Remove these entirely -->
<!-- <meta name="keywords">, <meta name="geo.region">, <meta name="geo.placename">, <meta name="geo.position">, <meta name="ICBM"> -->

2) Tighten title/description (reduce redundancy, keep CTR hooks)
<title>Elk Grove Security Guards (BSIS) | Armed & Unarmed | ShieldWise Security</title>
<meta name="description" content="BSIS-licensed security guards in Elk Grove, CA: armed & unarmed, mobile patrol, fire watch, residential & commercial. 24/7 response. Free quote: (714) 716-7430.">

3) Fix LocalBusiness JSON-LD (NAP + ratings)
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":["LocalBusiness","SecurityService","ProfessionalService"],
  "@id":"https://shieldwisesecurity.com/#elk-grove",
  "url":"https://shieldwisesecurity.com/sacramento-county/elk-grove",
  "name":"ShieldWise Security - Elk Grove",
  "description":"BSIS-licensed armed & unarmed security in Elk Grove, CA. Mobile patrol, fire watch, and 24/7 response.",
  "image":[
    "https://shieldwisesecurity.com/img/elk-grove-security-guards-hero.webp"
  ],
  "logo":"https://shieldwisesecurity.com/img/shieldwise-logo-2024.png",
  "priceRange":"$$",
  "telephone":"+1-714-716-7430",
  "address":{
    "@type":"PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress":"2750 Gateway Oaks Dr",
    "addressLocality":"Sacramento",
    "addressRegion":"CA",
    "postalCode":"95833",
    "addressCountry":"US"
  },
  "geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":38.5986,"longitude":-121.5132},
  "areaServed":{"@type":"City","name":"Elk Grove"},
  "openingHoursSpecification":[{
    "@type":"OpeningHoursSpecification",
    "dayOfWeek":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"],
    "opens":"00:00","closes":"23:59"
  }],
  "aggregateRating":{
    "@type":"AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue":"4.9",
    "reviewCount":"187",
    "bestRating":"5",
    "worstRating":"1"
  }
}
</script>


Notes:

If you truly have an Elk Grove office with a local address/phone, replace the above with that exact NAP. Otherwise, keep Sacramento and emphasize service area: Elk Grove (as shown).

Coordinates updated to match the Sacramento address; update to your real coordinates if different.

4) Review schema: keep only if the exact review is visible

If you keep the single Review, render the same quote & author in HTML. If not, remove the Review block to avoid structured-data mismatch warnings.

5) Service schema (use priceSpecification or simplify)
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Service",
  "name":"Armed Security Guard Services",
  "provider":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ShieldWise Security"},
  "areaServed":"Elk Grove, CA",
  "description":"Armed guards for businesses and residential communities in Elk Grove.",
  "offers":{
    "@type":"Offer",
    "priceSpecification":{
      "@type":"UnitPriceSpecification",
      "price":"45",
      "priceCurrency":"USD",
      "unitText":"HOUR"
    }
  }
}
</script>


(Or drop pricing entirely if it fluctuates.)

6) Social cards: point to Elk Grove assets
<meta property="og:image" content="https://shieldwisesecurity.com/img/elk-grove-security-guards-og-2025.webp">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://shieldwisesecurity.com/img/elk-grove-security-guards-twitter-2025.webp">

7) Performance hygiene

Combine your custom CSS into one file and remove unused Bootstrap components if possible.

Add explicit width/height on hero and testimonial images to cut CLS.

Defer non-critical icons (Font Awesome) or subset icons to reduce payload.

Nice-to-have upgrades

Add Organization/Website JSON-LD with a SearchAction.

Add BreadcrumbList @ids to match visible breadcrumbs (you already have it—good!).

Add internal links to nearby Elk Grove neighborhoods pages (Laguna, Laguna Creek, Stonelake) if you plan to create them.
