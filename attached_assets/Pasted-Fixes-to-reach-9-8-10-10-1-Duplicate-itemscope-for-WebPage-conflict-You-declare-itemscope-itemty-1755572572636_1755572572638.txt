Fixes to reach 9.8–10/10
1) Duplicate itemscope for WebPage (conflict)

You declare itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/WebPage" on both <html> and <body>. Keep it only once (on <html>).
Fix: remove itemscope itemtype from <body>.

<body id="top">

2) Hreflang alignment (consistency)

You only have en-US—great. Make sure there’s a self-referencing x-default to help Google pick a default, or add it later when you localize.

<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://shieldwisesecurity.com/ventura-county">

3) GBP/NAP authority (local SEO/E-E-A-T)

Swap your Google Maps link to the exact Google Business Profile Place URL and mirror the same NAP everywhere (site footer, JSON-LD).

Add a ContactPoint in Organization JSON-LD for local trust:

{
  "@type": "ContactPoint",
  "contactType": "customer service",
  "telephone": "+1-714-716-7430",
  "areaServed": "US-CA",
  "availableLanguage": ["English","Spanish"]
}


…and add it to sameAs/GBP accuracy.

4) CLS hardening (small but real)

You set width/height for the hero image (good). Do the same for all other images/icons that render as <img> (logo, any future cards).

Font Awesome <i> icons can’t have loading="lazy" (not an image). If any icons are inline <img>, add explicit width/height or style="aspect-ratio: …".

5) Icon accessibility & perf

Mark decorative FA icons aria-hidden="true" and add visible labels:

<i class="fas fa-user-shield icon-large" aria-hidden="true"></i>
<h4><span class="sr-only">Service:</span> Armed Security Guards</h4>


Consider replacing FA with inline SVGs for a tiny LCP/FOIT win.

6) Title branding & CTR nudge

Current title is strong for intent. Consider appending brand for brand queries/CTR:

<title>Ventura County Security Guards (BSIS) | 24/7 Patrol & Armed/Unarmed | ShieldWise</title>

7) JSON-LD minor enrichments (truthful only)

Add "founder"/"employee" count if you can substantiate (“150+ officers”) or "numberOfEmployees".

If you surface reviews on page, add "AggregateRating" (only if you actually show the rating/snippets on this page).

"aggregateRating": {
  "@type": "AggregateRating",
  "ratingValue": "4.9",
  "ratingCount": "127"
}

8) CWV quick wins

Keep only one render-blocking CSS (Bootstrap) and consider moving site CSS to a single minified file.

Preload your webfont file (WOFF2) to cut LCP:

<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" href="/fonts/montserrat-700.woff2" crossorigin>


(If you self-host fonts; otherwise, you’re fine with current Google Fonts + preconnect.)

9) Canonical normalization

Ensure internal links and sitemap use the same trailing-slash policy as your canonical (/ventura-county vs /ventura-county/). Keep it consistent everywhere.

Tiny copy edits (optional, trust)

Avoid hard promises like “zero incidents in 18 months” unless you can back them up—Google’s reviews policy and users look for credibility.

Add an “Industries we secure” list with anchor links for longer dwell time and site search convenience.

Patch snippets you can paste

}]
