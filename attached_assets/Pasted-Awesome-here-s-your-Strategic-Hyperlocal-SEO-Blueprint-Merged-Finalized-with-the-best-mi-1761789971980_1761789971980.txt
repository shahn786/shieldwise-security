# KPI & rollout checklist (fast)

* **Per city page:** 1 primary + 2 support keywords, 1 FAQ per keyword.
* **GBP:** Add the same services as Products; post one Update/week with a target keyword in the first sentence.
* **Citations:** Ensure exact **NAP** and link each listing to the **matching city landing page**.
* **Tracking:** Tag primary CTA with `utm_campaign=<city>_security_primary`. In CRM, attribute deals to the keyword used in the user’s first landing page session.
