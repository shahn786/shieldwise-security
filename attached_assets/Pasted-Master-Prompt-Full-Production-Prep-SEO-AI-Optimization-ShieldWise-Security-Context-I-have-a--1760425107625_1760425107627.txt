🚫 Hard Constraints

Preserve current visual style/layout. Only change if strictly necessary for perf/SEO/a11y.

Do not break URLs. If a change is unavoidable, add 301 redirects.

Remove only truly unused assets (images/CSS/JS/fonts).

No lorem ipsum. Keep a professional security-company voice.

🔍 Exact Tasks
1) Full Crawl & Inventory

Crawl the entire site (dev tree + rendered pages). Generate a URL inventory with status, title, h1, word count, indexability, canonical, inlinks/outlinks, images count, schema presence, and Core Web Vitals estimates.

Identify duplicates, near-duplicates, thin pages, orphan pages, 404s, and redirected chains.

2) Codebase Cleanup

Remove unused images, sprites, SVGs, icon sets, CSS, JS, fonts, and commented-out code.

PurgeCSS (or equivalent) to remove unused CSS safely.

Split/minify bundles; defer/async non-critical JS; remove unused libraries.

Normalize path casing; fix broken relative paths.

Convert heavy images → WebP/AVIF; keep JPG/PNG as fallback via <picture>.

Implement responsive srcset, sizes, lazy-loading, decoding="async", and intrinsic dimensions for CLS.

3) Information Architecture & Content Quality

Normalize templates for: Services, City pages, About, Contact/Quote, FAQs, Industries served, Case studies/Patrol logs (if any).

Enforce E-E-A-T: licensing, insurance, coverage areas, certifications, leadership, privacy/terms.

Ensure unique local content per city (local risks/needs, response times, landmarks, tailored benefits).

Tighten headings: single H1, logical H2/H3; meaningful alt text (no stuffing).

4) Technical SEO & AI Indexing

Canonicals on every page (no loops).

Robots.txt: allow key sections; disallow admin/build/params; add Sitemap: pointers.

Sitemaps: /sitemap.xml → split children (pages/cities/images).

Schema coverage (see Deliverables). Validate with rich results.

AI-retrieval friendly content blocks: clear Q&A, definitions (e.g., “What is Fire Watch?”), checklists/SOP summaries, comparison tables.

Build a /resources or /knowledge-base hub if present; interlink from service/city pages.

Ensure breadcrumbs (visible + JSON-LD).

5) Performance Engineering

Optimize critical path: inline critical CSS only if it materially improves LCP.

Preconnect/preload key assets (fonts, hero image) where justified by measurements.

Reduce third-party scripts; load non-critical ones after interaction.

Strong cache-control for static assets; hashed filenames; HTML short-cache.

6) Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA essentials)

Landmarks (header/nav/main/footer), skip links.

Labels & error text for forms; focus states; keyboard access.

Contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for text. If any fail, fix with minimal visual impact.

7) Forms & Conversion

Ensure Contact/Quote forms post to the right endpoint; add spam protection (reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha).

Add conversion tracking hooks for GA4.

Validate client/server side with friendly messages.

8) Security & Reliability

Enforce HTTPS; add HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options/frame-ancestors, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, and CSP (start with report-only if needed).

Remove secrets, dev endpoints, stack traces.

Custom 404 and 500 pages; use 410 for intentionally removed content.

Add .well-known/security.txt.

9) Local SEO Must-Haves

Consistent NAP site-wide (footer, Contact, schema).

LocalBusiness per location/city page with areaServed, geo, hasMap, openingHours.

Link to Google Business Profile; embed map or driving directions.

If real reviews exist, surface a subset and consider Review/AggregateRating schema (only if verifiable).

10) Legal & Compliance

Privacy Policy, Terms, Cookie/Tracking disclosure; consent banner if tracking across regions.

Basic ADA compliance covered under Accessibility.

11) Monitoring & QA

Add Lighthouse CI (mobile) to CI/CD; save reports.

Add Playwright smoke tests for top flows (home → service → city → quote form).

Add axe-core a11y checks to CI.

Optional: hook Sentry for front-end error monitoring and uptime pings.

✅ Output & Handover Requirements

Provide a zipped production build.

Provide a PR / commit with clear messages grouped by area (perf/SEO/a11y/cleanup).

Include /reports and all config files for chosen hosting.

Confirm GA4/GSC/Bing verification and submit sitemaps (document steps if I need to click verify).

Provide a 1-page runbook: “How to deploy,” “How to add a new city/service page correctly,” and “How to keep Core Web Vitals green.”

🔁 Work Plan

Phase 1 — Audit & Plan: Crawl, measure, and produce a P0/P1/P2 roadmap with examples.
Phase 2 — Implement: Apply fixes, generate build & reports, open PR, and hand off.

❓Clarifications (answer briefly; use defaults if not provided)

Hosting to target (choose one): Vercel / Netlify / cPanel / VPS / Replit / Other.

Canonical street address to use everywhere (footer + schema).

Google Business Profile URL.

GA4 / GSC / Bing IDs or add placeholders.

Form endpoints + whether to add reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha.

Approve converting heavy images to WebP/AVIF and adding srcset + lazy-load.

Provide the authoritative California cities list you serve (CSV or list) for sitemap & schema.

Any legacy URLs that must remain (so we add 301 redirects if slugs change).

🔚 Final Instruction

Proceed now. Re-check every page and file, optimize thoroughly per the above, preserve the site’s look, and deliver a production-ready, SEO/AI-optimized build with reports and configs.
