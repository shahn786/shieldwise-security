What's the difference between armed and unarmed security guards?
acceptedAnswer

Answer

Armed security guards carry firearms and require additional licensing and training. They're ideal for high-risk environments, valuable asset protection, and situations requiring maximum deterrence. Unarmed guards focus on observation, reporting, and customer service, making them perfect for retail, residential, and low-risk commercial properties.
