Structured Data (JSON-LD) Must Be Inside <script type="application/ld+json"> Tags
What’s wrong:
You have raw JSON-LD structured data objects directly in your <head>, not inside <script type="application/ld+json"> tags. For example:

js
Copy
Edit
// schema-organization.js
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  ...
}
But this is just plain JSON—not JavaScript, not HTML, and not a valid <script> tag.
Search engines will ignore this (or even throw errors in the Search Console).

How to fix:
Every JSON-LD block must be inside a <script type="application/ld+json"> ... </script> tag.
You cannot just paste JSON directly into your HTML!

2. You Are Pasting Multiple JSON Objects, Separated by Comments (Not Allowed in JSON)
What’s wrong:
You have things like:

js
Copy
Edit
// schema-organization.js
{ ... }
 // schema-services.js
{ ... }
 // schema-faq.js
{ ... }
This is not valid JavaScript and not valid JSON-LD, because:

Comments // ... are not allowed in JSON.

Each block must be its own <script type="application/ld+json"> ... </script> or be combined as an array under "@graph" in a single script.

3. Where Should You Place the <script type="application/ld+json"> Tags?
Put each schema (organization, services, FAQ, breadcrumb, article, webpage, website, etc.) inside its own <script type="application/ld+json"> tag, right before the closing </head>.

DO NOT include any comments (// ...) inside JSON-LD scripts.

4. Example: How to Fix This
Original (Incorrect):

html
Copy
Edit
// schema-organization.js
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [ ... ]
}
Correct (FIXED):

html
Copy
Edit
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [ ... ]
}
</script>
Repeat this for each block (schema-organization, schema-services, schema-faq, etc).

5. Do Not Mix XML (Sitemap) in the <head> Section
At the very end of your code, you have what looks like a sitemap in XML format (<?xml ...><urlset ...>).

This is NOT valid in the HTML <head> section.
Sitemaps are separate files (e.g., sitemap.xml) on your server, not embedded in your HTML.
Remove this entire XML block from your HTML.

6. How to Fix Your HEAD (Quick Example):
Below is how your <head> section should look regarding structured data:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- ...your existing meta tags, CSS, JS links, etc. ... -->

<!-- Structured Data: Organization -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@type": ["LocalBusiness", "SecurityService", "Service"],
      "@id": "https://shieldwisesecurity.com/#organization",
      ...
      "sameAs": [
        "https://www.facebook.com/shieldwisesecurity",
        "https://twitter.com/shieldwisesecurity",
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</script>

<!-- Structured Data: Services -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@type": "Service",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
</script>

<!-- Structured Data: FAQ -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    ...
  ]
}
</script>

<!-- etc. for other schemas (breadcrumb, article, webpage, website) -->

<!-- Do NOT include sitemap XML here -->
7. Summary Table: What to Change
Issue	What’s Wrong	How to Fix
JSON-LD not in script	Raw JSON/JS in head	Wrap each block with <script type="application/ld+json"> ... </script>
Comments in JSON	// ... in JSON	Remove all comments inside JSON-LD
Multiple blocks	Multiple JSONs pasted	Each needs its own <script type="application/ld+json"> or combine under "@graph"
XML sitemap in head	<urlset> ... </urlset> in HTML	Remove, use as standalone sitemap.xml file

8. Bonus: Script Loading
If you want to load JSON-LD dynamically, you may use <script src="..."> for JS, but structured data MUST be inline JSON-LD, not JS files.

Next Steps for You
Go through your <head> and wrap each JSON-LD schema block in its own <script type="application/ld+json"> ... </script> tag.

Remove any // comments and any XML (sitemap) markup.

Validate your page with Google's Rich Results Test to check for schema errors after fixing.

If You Want Me to Generate a "FIXED" HEAD for You
Let me know, and I’ll paste your current schemas properly formatted and ready to copy-paste into your site, with all the above corrections applied!

TL;DR:

Wrap every JSON-LD schema in <script type="application/ld+json"> ... </script>.

Remove comments and XML from your HTML head.

Each schema goes in its own script block (or combine in one "@graph" array if you prefer).

Validate after updating!
