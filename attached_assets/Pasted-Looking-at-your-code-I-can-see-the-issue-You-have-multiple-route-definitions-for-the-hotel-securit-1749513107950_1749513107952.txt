Looking at your code, I can see the issue. You have multiple route definitions for the hotel security service, and there's a conflict in how they're being handled. Let me trace through the problem and provide a solution.
The Problem

Multiple Route Definitions: In your main server file, you have:
javascriptconst hotelSecurityRoutes = require('./routes/hotel-security');
app.use('/services/hotel-security', hotelSecurityRoutes);

Route Conflict: The separate route file (routes/hotel-security.js) is likely overriding your intended template.
Template Mismatch: When you click the link, it's loading a different template than views/services/hotel-security.ejs.

The SolutionFixed Hotel Security Route HandlerCode // In your main server file (app.js or server.js)
// Remove or comment out the existing hotel security route import
// const hotelSecurityRoutes = require('./routes/hotel-security');
// app.use('/services/hotel-security', hotelSecurityRoutes);

// AdAdditional Steps to Fix the Issue:
1. Clear Browser Cache and Server Cache
Add this temporary debugging route to see what's happening:
javascriptapp.get('/debug/hotel-security', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    message: 'Debug route working',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    routeActive: true
  });
});
2. Check Route Order
Make sure your hotel security route is defined before any catch-all routes. In your server file, place the hotel security route near the top of your route definitions:
javascript// Place this early in your route definitions
app.get('/services/hotel-security', (req, res) => {
  // ... route handler code
});

// Other routes come after
app.use('/services/apartment-security', apartmentSecurityRouter);
// ... other routes
3. Remove Conflicting Route Files
If you have a separate routes/hotel-security.js file that you don't want to use, either:

Delete it entirely, or
Comment out the line that imports it in your main server file

4. Verify Template Path
Make sure your template file exists at: views/services/hotel-security.ejs
5. Restart Your Server
After making these changes:

Stop your server completely
Clear any cached modules: rm -rf node_modules/.cache (if applicable)
Restart the server

6. Add Debugging
Add this console log to see which route is being hit:
javascriptapp.use('/services/*', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`🔍 Services route hit: ${req.originalUrl}`);
  next();
});
The issue is likely that the separate route file (routes/hotel-security.js) is taking precedence over your intended template. By using the direct route handler I provided above and ensuring it's placed correctly in your route order, your views/services/hotel-security.ejs template should load properly.
