Significant Issues
Title Tag Problems (5/10)
html<!-- Current title is problematic -->
<title>California Apartment Security Services | 24/7 Guards from $35/hr | ShieldWise</title>
Issues:

Too long (80+ characters)
Price in title tag is risky for SEO
Could be more compelling

Meta Keywords Tag (0/10)
html<meta name="keywords" content="apartment security services...">
This is completely outdated and should be removed. Search engines haven't used this since 2009.
Non-Standard AI Tags (3/10)
html<meta name="ai-search-intent" content="...">
<meta name="ai-search-entity" content="...">
<!-- Multiple other ai-* tags -->
These are not recognized by any search engines and add unnecessary bloat.
Schema Redundancy (6/10)
There's significant duplication in the schema markup - the same information appears in multiple schema blocks, which could confuse search engines.
Excessive City Listings (7/10)
While comprehensive coverage is good, listing 100+ cities in schema might be seen as spam by search engines. Focus on primary service areas.
Recommendations for Improvement
1. Fix Title Tag
html<title>Apartment Security Services California | ShieldWise Security</title>
2. Remove Outdated Elements
html<!-- Remove these entirely -->
<meta name="keywords" content="...">

LocalBusiness
Service
FAQPage
Reviews

4. Streamline City Coverage
Focus on primary markets (10-15 major cities) rather than listing every California city.
5. Improve Meta Description
Make it more compelling and action-oriented while keeping key information.
