Summary of Issues Fixed
I've identified and fixed the key issues in your South Gate code:
Main Problems Found:

Map Section Issues:

Problem: The iframe had redundant attributes (width="100%", height="400", frameborder="0", style="border:0;")
Fix: Removed redundant attributes and kept only the necessary ones like the working Burbank version


FAQ Accordion Issues:

Problem: Missing Popper.js dependency and conflicting custom JavaScript
Fix: Added proper Bootstrap JavaScript loading pattern (jQuery + Popper.js + Bootstrap.js) and removed conflicting custom accordion code


CSS Loading Issues:

Problem: Missing media="screen" attributes on CSS links
Fix: Added consistent media attributes like the working Burbank version



Key Changes Made:

Fixed Map iframe:
html<!-- BEFORE (Broken) -->
<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" 
        src="..." 
        width="100%" 
        height="400" 
        frameborder="0" 
        style="border:0;" 
        allowfullscreen="" 
        loading="lazy">

<!-- AFTER (Fixed) -->
<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" 
        src="..." 
        allowfullscreen="" 
        loading="lazy" 
        title="...">

Fixed JavaScript Loading:
html<!-- BEFORE (Broken) -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>

<!-- AFTER (Fixed) -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.1/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

Removed Conflicting Custom JavaScript:

Removed the complex custom accordion initialization code
Kept only essential functionality (back-to-top button, lazy loading)



Why This Fixes Both Issues:

Map Display: Removing conflicting CSS attributes allows Bootstrap's responsive classes to work properly
FAQ Accordion: Adding Popper.js and using the correct Bootstrap loading sequence ensures the collapse functionality works

The fixed version now matches the working pattern from your Burbank page and should resolve both the map display and FAQ accordion expansion issues.
