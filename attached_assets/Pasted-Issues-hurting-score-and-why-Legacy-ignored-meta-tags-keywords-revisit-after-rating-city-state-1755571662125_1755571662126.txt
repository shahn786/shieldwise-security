Issues hurting score (and why)

Legacy/ignored meta tags
keywords, revisit-after, rating, city/state/zipcode/coordinates/ICBM/region/locality offer no benefit and add noise.

**Possible schema misuse

You use @type: LocalBusiness with a serviceArea array of “City” objects. For LocalBusiness the correct property is areaServed (Place | AdministrativeArea | GeoShape | Text).

Consider declaring both LocalBusiness and a Service entity in an @graph.

AggregateRating on LocalBusiness can be ineligible for review stars and may trigger quality scrutiny if reviews are first-party. Better attach rating to Service (optional) or omit.

Title/description length + redundancy

Title is a bit long and repeats “Professional/BSIS Licensed.”

Description exceeds optimal snippet width and reads like a keyword dump.

Open Graph type
og:type="business.business" is fine for a place, but this is a landing page; using website (or article if longform) usually yields more consistent previews.

Fonts & blocking resources

You include Google Fonts twice (preload + regular link) which can be redundant.

Bootstrap/Font Awesome lack SRI (subresource integrity).

Two font families with many weights can increase CLS/LCP.

Hero as CSS background
Background images don’t reserve space → potential CLS. Preloading helps, but a responsive <picture> with width/height (or aspect-ratio) is better.

Canonical/slug clarity
Canonical is /ventura but the page targets Ventura County. If you also have a city page for Ventura (you do), consider /ventura-county to avoid ambiguity/cannibalization.

E-E-A-T signals
No visible BSIS license #, office NAP consistency, or link to your Google Business Profile. These help trust and local rankings.

Quick wins (do these first)

Tighten title + description

<title>Ventura County Security Guards (BSIS) | 24/7 Patrol & Armed/Unarmed</title>
<meta name="description" content="BSIS-licensed security guards for Ventura County: armed/unarmed, mobile patrol, coastal & agricultural sites. Fast deployment and free quote at (714) 716-7430.">


Hreflang + canonical (county-specific)

<link rel="canonical" href="https://shieldwisesecurity.com/ventura-county">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-US" href="https://shieldwisesecurity.com/ventura-county">


Resource integrity & fonts (reduce blocking)

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@500;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

Drop Roboto or Montserrat to one family to cut weight.

Structured data: safer, richer @graph

Replace your LocalBusiness block with this (keep your FAQ block as-is):

<script type="application/ld+json">

Why: fixes serviceArea → areaServed, avoids self-serving ratings on LocalBusiness, adds WebSite + BreadcrumbList, and clarifies county targeting.

Core Web Vitals improvements

Hero image as real element to reserve space:

<section class="hero-sec">
  <picture>
    <source srcset="/img/ventura.webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="/img/ventura.jpg" alt="Security patrol overlooking Ventura Harbor"
         width="1920" height="1080" fetchpriority="high" loading="eager"
         style="object-fit:cover; width:100%; height:100%; aspect-ratio:16/9;">
  </picture>
  <div class="overlay-sec">...</div>
</section>


Then remove the CSS background. This reduces CLS and often improves LCP.

Lazy-load noncritical images/icons:
Add loading="lazy" decoding="async" to below-the-fold images.

Reduce font weight variants: keep Montserrat 500/700 only.

Content & trust (Local SEO)

Add BSIS license #, insurance details, and service footprint (dispatch hours).

Add a short About / team summary + link to Google reviews (don’t mark up first-party reviews on LocalBusiness).

Ensure NAP on this page matches your GBP and footer.

Minor polish

Switch og:url and all internal references to the final county slug.

Add twitter:site with your handle.

Ensure CDN files include SRI (add real hashes).

Keep a single Google Fonts link (remove the extra preload, or convert preload to rel="preload" as="style" onload="this.rel='stylesheet'" and keep only one effective stylesheet).
