Master Prompt (Pre-Filled for ShieldWise Security)

Context:
I have a 100+ page website for ShieldWise Security (shieldwisesecurity.com). The codebase lives here: https://replit.com/@FnuShahnawaz/ShieldWise-Security. I want you to audit, clean, and optimize the entire site for production hosting, SEO (Google/Bing), and AI indexing—while preserving my current look and layout unless a change is essential for performance, accessibility, or SEO.

Inputs:

Repo/Codebase: https://replit.com/@FnuShahnawaz/ShieldWise-Security

Domain: shieldwisesecurity.com

Tech stack: “All” (the project contains HTML/CSS/JS and may include Node/EJS or other)

Hosting target: (to confirm—see questions below)

Primary service area: All cities in California (multi-city pages exist)

Business NAP (canonical):

Name: ShieldWise Security

Phone: +1-714-716-7430

Address: (Please normalize to one exact street address for all pages/schema—ask me if missing)

Priority pages: Homepage, Services, City pages, Contact / Get a Quote

Analytics/Webmaster tools: GA4 / Google Search Console / Bing Webmaster Tools (IDs to be provided)

1) Goals (Definition of Done)

Production-ready build: clean, organized, minified, cacheable, and deployable.

SEO-ready: correct metadata, internal linking, structured data, sitemaps, robots, canonicalization.

AI-search-ready: clear entities (security services), FAQs/Q&A blocks, strong LocalBusiness schema.

Performance: Mobile Core Web Vitals targets — LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1.

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA essentials without changing visual style unless necessary.

Security: HTTPS, sane security headers, no secrets in repo.

Local SEO: Consistent NAP, per-city unique value, correct schema.

2) Hard Constraints

Do not change design/branding unless absolutely required for SEO/perf/a11y.

Remove only truly unused assets (images/CSS/JS).

Do not break existing URLs; if a change is needed, create 301 redirects.

No lorem ipsum. Keep tone aligned to a professional security company.

3) Deliverables

Cleaned production build with:

Purged/treeshaken CSS & JS; minified assets; proper caching; hashed filenames.

Optimized images: responsive sizes, srcset, WebP/AVIF variants, lazy-load below fold.

SEO/AI package for all indexable pages:

Unique titles and meta descriptions (click-through friendly).

Open Graph & Twitter cards; favicon & web manifest.

Structured data (JSON-LD):

Organization + WebSite (+ SearchAction)

LocalBusiness / SecurityService (global + per city/service page)

BreadcrumbList

Service (per service page)

FAQPage where relevant

Review/AggregateRating (only if we have real, verifiable data)

XML sitemaps (split by pages / cities / images) + robots.txt tuned for crawl budget.

Canonical tags everywhere; hreflang if applicable later.

Internal linking map (services ↔ industries ↔ city pages ↔ blog/resources).

Reports & Handover:

Before/after Lighthouse (mobile) + Core Web Vitals notes.

SEO_issues.csv (URL, Issue, Priority, Fix).

Redirect map (if any).

Deployment checklist (headers, redirects, cache rules).

Instructions to verify GA4, GSC, Bing and submit sitemaps.

4) Detailed Tasks
A) Information Architecture & Content

Normalize templates for Services, City pages, About, Contact/Quote, FAQs.

Strengthen E-E-A-T: licensing, insurance, service coverage, industries served, testimonials (if permitted), privacy/terms.

Ensure unique, local content on each California city page (no thin/duplicate content).

Enforce NAP consistency site-wide (footer, Contact, schema).

B) On-Page SEO

One H1 per page; semantic H2/H3.

Titles ≤ 60 chars; meta descriptions 140–160 chars; descriptive alt text.

Visible breadcrumbs + JSON-LD.

Preserve current slugs; add redirects if any slug must change.

C) Technical SEO & AI Indexing

Build /sitemap.xml that points to split sitemaps (pages, cities, images).

Author robots.txt to allow key sections, disallow duplicates/admin/build artifacts; include sitemap pointer.

Add Service and LocalBusiness JSON-LD to key pages; validate with Rich Results.

Add FAQPage JSON-LD to service/city pages where Q&A exists.

Make core offerings explicit: armed/unarmed guards, mobile patrol, construction site security, fire watch, neighborhood security, school/campus, retail, events, etc.

D) Performance

Convert large images to WebP/AVIF; responsive sizes; defer non-critical JS; reduce 3P scripts.

Inline critical CSS only if it materially improves LCP.

Use preconnect/preload for fonts/critical assets where beneficial.

Strong cache headers for static assets; Brotli/Gzip on host.

E) Accessibility

Semantic landmarks (header/nav/main/footer), form labels, focus states, contrast fixes only if failing.

Keyboard navigation (no traps).

F) Security & Reliability

Enforce HTTPS; add HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options/COOP/COEP, and CSP if feasible.

Remove secrets/comments/dev endpoints.

Friendly 404; 410 where appropriate.

5) Process

Phase 1 — Audit & Plan: Provide prioritized plan (P0/P1/P2) with concrete examples from my site.

Phase 2 — Implement: Apply fixes in a branch/PR or a zipped build. Include diffs/notes.

Preserve design unless a change is essential.

6) Acceptance Criteria

Mobile Lighthouse ≥ 90 (Performance, SEO, Best Practices, Accessibility) for homepage + top services + one city page.

GSC & Bing verified; sitemaps submitted; no major coverage errors; key pages indexed.

Structured data validates cleanly (no critical errors).

No broken links or regressions; canonicalization correct; NAP consistent.

Questions to Clarify (answer briefly so work can start)

Hosting target (pick one): Vercel / Netlify / cPanel (shared) / VPS / Replit / Other.

Actual stack in use: Is the live code purely static HTML/CSS/JS, or does it also use Node/EJS (templates) or another framework in that Replit?

Canonical street address (exact address to use everywhere + in schema).

Google Business Profile URL (if you have it).

GA4 + GSC + Bing IDs/emails (or confirm you want placeholders added so you can verify later).

Forms: Where should Contact/Get a Quote submit? (Email service / API endpoint). Do you want reCAPTCHA?

Reviews: Do you have verifiable reviews/ratings we can mark up (source + rating count)?

Image policy: Approve converting large images to WebP/AVIF and adding lazy-loading and responsive srcset?

City list: Provide the authoritative list of California cities you serve so we can standardize city pages and internal links.

Any legacy URLs that must stay live? (We’ll add 301s if slugs change.)
