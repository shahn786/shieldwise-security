Trust and Safety
Ensure CSP is effective against XSS attacks
A strong Content Security Policy (CSP) significantly reduces the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Learn how to use a CSP to prevent XSS
Description
Directive
Severity
Host allowlists can frequently be bypassed. Consider using CSP nonces or hashes instead, along with `'strict-dynamic'` if necessary.
script-src
High
`'unsafe-inline'` allows the execution of unsafe in-page scripts and event handlers. Consider using CSP nonces or hashes to allow scripts individually.
script-src
High
`'unsafe-inline'` allows the execution of unsafe in-page scripts and event handlers. Consider using CSP nonces or hashes to allow scripts individually.
script-src-attr
High
'unsafe-hashes', while safer than 'unsafe-inline', allows the execution of unsafe in-page scripts and event handlers as long as their hashes appear in the CSP. Please refactor them to no longer use inline scripts if possible.

Mitigate DOM-based XSS with Trusted Types
The require-trusted-types-for directive in the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header instructs user agents to control the data passed to DOM XSS sink functions. Learn more about mitigating DOM-based XSS with Trusted Types.
Description
Severity
No `Content-Security-Policy` header with Trusted Types directive found
