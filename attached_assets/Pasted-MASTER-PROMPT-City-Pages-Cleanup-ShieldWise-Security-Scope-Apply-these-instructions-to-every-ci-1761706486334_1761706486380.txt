MASTER PROMPT — City Pages Cleanup (ShieldWise Security)
Scope

Apply these instructions to every city/location page (e.g., Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Jose, etc.). Pages include HTML/EJS content, headings, hero, body sections, CTAs, FAQs, and footers.

Variables

{{CITY}} – the city name (e.g., “Anaheim”)

{{STATE}} – “California”

{{COMPANY}} – “ShieldWise Security”

Primary Goals

Insert one clear sentence mentioning the city that states we’re the cheapest and best:

Place directly under the H1 (or first hero heading) as a single sentence:

Cheapest and best security guard services in {{CITY}}, California.

If a more natural version fits the page tone, you may use:

ShieldWise Security provides the cheapest and best security guard services in {{CITY}}, California.

Ensure only one instance per page (no duplicates).

Remove or neutralize all prices on city pages:

Delete any explicit prices/rates (e.g., “$35/hr”, “$xxx per hour”, “starting at $xx”).

Where a price sentence is needed for context, replace with this neutral market statement (not a quote from us):

Regular market prices for licensed security guards in {{CITY}} vary by scope, schedule, and risk level. These are typical industry ranges—not {{COMPANY}} quotes. For our pricing (often the lowest in {{CITY}}), request a custom quote.

If a section is only a price table, remove the table and insert a short paragraph using the neutral statement above plus a “Get a Quote” CTA link/button.

Make it crystal-clear those prices aren’t ours:

When you keep any general pricing commentary, always include:

Note: Market rates shown are general industry references for {{CITY}} and are not {{COMPANY}}’s prices. {{COMPANY}} frequently provides cheaper, customized rates based on your needs.

SEO & Copy Polish (keep concise, professional)

Keep H1 as-is (don’t add prices to H1).

Ensure the new sentence appears once, under H1/hero, in plain text (no small/hidden styles).

Improve grammar/flow across the page, but do not add numbers/$$ in copy or metadata.

If any JSON-LD/structured data includes explicit price fields for services, remove those fields (do not invent prices).

Keep city/local keywords natural: “security guard services in {{CITY}}, {{STATE}}”, “armed/unarmed guards”, “mobile patrol”, “fire watch”, etc.

CTAs

Where you removed prices, add/keep:

Button text: “Get Your Custom Quote”

Subtext: “Often the lowest price in {{CITY}}—tailored to your site.”

Do Not Change

Phone, email, license details, service lists, testimonials, service coverage statements.

Don’t add any dollar amounts anywhere on these city pages.

Find/Replace Guidance

Remove lines/blocks containing price patterns like:
$, USD, /hr, per hour, starting at, from $, hourly rate, rate: $, Price: $, $$.

Remove price columns in tables; keep non-price service info.

If a paragraph becomes empty after removal, delete it and maintain clean spacing.

Final Checks

Exactly one of the following appears under H1:

“Cheapest and best security guard services in {{CITY}}, California.”
OR

“ShieldWise Security provides the cheapest and best security guard services in {{CITY}}, California.”

No explicit numbers/$$ remain on the page body, headings, footers, FAQs, schema, or meta.

At least one strong CTA exists near the top and bottom.

No duplicate new sentence. No leftover empty sections/gaps.

Example (before → after)

Before:
“H1: {{CITY}} Security Guards — From $35/hr”
Paragraph: “We charge $35–$45/hr for unarmed and $45–$55/hr for armed.”

After:
“H1: {{CITY}} Security Guards”
(Insert below H1)
“Cheapest and best security guard services in {{CITY}}, California.”
Paragraph (replaced):
“Regular market prices for licensed security guards in {{CITY}} vary by scope, schedule, and risk level. These are typical industry ranges—not ShieldWise Security quotes. For our pricing (often the lowest in {{CITY}}), request a custom quote.”
