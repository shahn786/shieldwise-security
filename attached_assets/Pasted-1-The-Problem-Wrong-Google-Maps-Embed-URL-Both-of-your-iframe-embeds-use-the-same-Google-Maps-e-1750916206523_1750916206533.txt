1. The Problem: Wrong Google Maps Embed URL
Both of your <iframe> embeds use the same Google Maps embed URL, which is for Burbank, CA:

HTML
src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!...0x80c2955b1db1904f%3A0x47fde469c268f39b!2sBurbank%2C%20CA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1650000000000!5m2!1sen!2sus"
So, even though your section titles and lists change, the map you're embedding is always for Burbank.
If your South Gate page is not showing any map at all, one of these is likely:

The embed code is being blocked (perhaps by a browser extension, adblocker, or CORS policy).
The section is being hidden by CSS or removed by JavaScript.
A typo or syntax error elsewhere is breaking the rendering of this section.
The embed code itself is incorrect or malformed (but you pasted the working Burbank embed).
2. Steps to Fix:
A. Use the Correct Google Maps Embed URL for South Gate
You need to generate a Google Map embed link for South Gate, CA, not Burbank.

Here’s how:

Go to Google Maps
Search for “South Gate, CA”
Click the “Share” button
Switch to the “Embed a map” tab, and copy the HTML <iframe> code.
It should look something like this (the src will be different):

HTML
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!...!2sSouth%20Gate%2C%20CA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4vYOUR_UNIQUE_ID"
  width="600"
  height="450"
  style="border:0;"
  allowfullscreen=""
  loading="lazy"
  referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">
</iframe>
Replace the <iframe> in your South Gate section with this!

B. Double-Check HTML Structure
Your code otherwise looks fine and matches the working section.

C. Check for CSS/JS Issues
Make sure no CSS (display:none, visibility:hidden) is hiding the map container.
Make sure no JS is removing the map element.
Open browser dev tools (F12), inspect the element, and see if the iframe is in the DOM.
3. Summary
The sections are identical except for headings and lists.
The map does not show for South Gate because you are still embedding the Burbank map.
Get the correct embed code for South Gate, replace it, and it should display.
4. Example: South Gate Embed
Replace this block in your South Gate code:

HTML
<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d52876.83631213732!2d-118.35590658136717!3d34.18112210000001!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x80c2955b1db1904f%3A0x47fde469c268f39b!2sBurbank%2C%20CA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1650000000000!5m2!1sen!2sus" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" title="Map of Burbank, California showing ShieldWise Security service areas"></iframe>
with a new embed link for South Gate, e.g.:

HTML
<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d423286.27426296544!2d-118.5246982!3d33.9445409!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x80c2c7e2b3f2b2d9%3A0x5d5b6b8f9b2b2b9b!2sSouth%20Gate%2C%20CA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1650000000000!5m2!1sen!2sus" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" title="Map of South Gate, California showing ShieldWise Security service areas"></iframe>
(the above is an example; use the actual code from Google Maps!)

If the map still doesn’t appear after this, check your browser console for errors and make sure your network is not blocking Google Maps.
