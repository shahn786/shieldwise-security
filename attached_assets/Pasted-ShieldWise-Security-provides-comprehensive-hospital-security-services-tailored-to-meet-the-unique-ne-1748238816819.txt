Our surveillance solutions include strategically placed cameras and monitoring systems that provide real-time oversight of hospital premises. These systems not only enhance security but also assist in incident investigation and provide valuable evidence when necessary.

Visitor management protocols are enforced to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to restricted areas. This includes verifying identification, issuing visitor badges, and escorting visitors as needed, all of which contribute to a controlled and secure environment.

Our security officers are trained in emergency response procedures, including handling active shooter situations, fire evacuations, and medical emergencies. They are equipped to act swiftly and effectively, minimizing risks and ensuring the safety of everyone on the premises.

In addition to physical security measures, we offer cybersecurity services to protect electronic protected health information (ePHI) and ensure compliance with regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
