What Does “Best Practices 9” Refer To?
This rating is about how well your HTML head and scripts follow modern web standards for:

Accessibility (making your site usable for everyone, including those with disabilities),

Performance (using <link rel="preconnect"> to speed up loading),

Tracking (properly adding analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.),

Privacy (e.g., anonymizing IPs, setting privacy modes),

Cleanliness (not repeating or bloating meta/scripts/CSS unnecessarily).

2. Which Code is Involved?
It mainly refers to all the <meta>, <link>, and <script> blocks in your HTML <head> and the setup in your EJS partials.
Specifically:

Your <meta> tags for accessibility, viewport, color schemes, etc.

<link rel="preconnect"> for fonts, analytics, etc.

Tracking scripts: Google Analytics, Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel, Microsoft Clarity.

Privacy protection JS snippets.

How CSS files are linked (and their names).

Not repeating the same meta/scripts multiple times in the same page.

Examples from Your Code
Accessibility/Viewport/Color-Scheme:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0, user-scalable=yes">
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">
<meta name="supported-color-schemes" content="light dark">
Preconnect for Performance:

html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://www.google-analytics.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://www.googletagmanager.com" crossorigin>
Tracking & Privacy:

html
Copy
Edit
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<!-- Google Tag Manager, Microsoft Clarity, Facebook Pixel, etc. -->
<script>
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', { 
    'anonymize_ip': true,
    'allow_google_signals': false,
    'allow_ad_personalization_signals': false,
    // ...etc...
  });
</script>
<script>
  if (typeof window.dataLayer !== 'undefined') {
    window.dataLayer.push({
      'privacy_mode': true,
      'anonymize_data': true,
      'client_confidentiality': 'maximum'
    });
  }
</script>
CSS Naming/Loading:

html
Copy
Edit
<link href="/css/apartment-security.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
If this is for Executive Protection, you might rename to /css/executive-protection.min.css for clarity.

3. How to Improve (“Remove extra script/meta blocks, rename CSS”)
Remove Duplicate <meta>/<script>:
You had repeated blocks for meta charset, description, keywords, Open Graph, etc. Clean so each appears once in the head.

Rename CSS Files If Needed:
If you’re using /css/apartment-security.min.css for an executive protection page, consider renaming for clarity and maintainability:
/css/executive-protection.min.css.
