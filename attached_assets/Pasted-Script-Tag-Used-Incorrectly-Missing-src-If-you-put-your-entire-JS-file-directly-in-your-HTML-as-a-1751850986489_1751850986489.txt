Script Tag Used Incorrectly (Missing src)
If you put your entire JS file directly in your HTML as a string or inside a <script> tag without type="text/javascript" or accidentally paste code in the wrong place, the browser may render it as text.

Correct usage:

HTML
<script src="/Public/JS/performance-optimization.js"></script>
Incorrect (would show code as content):

HTML
<body>
{ imageObserver.observe(image); ... }
</body>
or

HTML
<script>
{ imageObserver.observe(image); ... }
</script>
(If you use { ... } directly in HTML, the browser will treat it as text.)

2. Your JavaScript File Is Requested as HTML
If you link or embed your script file in a way that makes the server return it as text/html (not application/javascript), the browser might display the code as text.

How this happens:

Your web server is misconfigured and sends JS files as HTML.
You visit the JS file directly in your browser and see code (this is normal if you open the JS file URL directly).
3. Your Build/Template Is Outputting JS Code as a Variable
If you use { ... } (curly braces) in a templating system that expects HTML (e.g., React, Handlebars, EJS), and you output raw JS code, that code will be shown as text.

How to Fix
A. Double-check Your HTML
Make sure your HTML includes your script like this:

HTML
<!-- Should be just before </body> -->
<script src="/Public/JS/performance-optimization.js"></script>
B. Don't Paste JS Code Directly in HTML
Never put your raw JS code inside { ... } or directly in your HTML outside of <script> tags.

C. Check for Templating Mistakes
If your framework uses {} for variable interpolation (like React, Vue, EJS, etc.), make sure you’re not accidentally outputting JS code instead of HTML.

D. Server MIME Type
Make sure your server is serving .js files as application/javascript and not as text/html or another type.

If You Need to Render a Website, Not Code:
The browser needs valid HTML inside <body>, not JS code.
JS code should be in a separate .js file or inside a <script> tag.
Make sure nothing like { ... } is outside of <script> tags.
Summary Table
Problem	What Happens	Solution
JS pasted in HTML body	Code shown as text	Move JS to <script> tag or external file
JS referenced incorrectly	Code shown as text	Use <script src="..."></script>
Templating system outputting JS code	Code shown as text	Output only HTML, not code
Server sending JS as HTML	Browser renders code as text	Fix server to send correct MIME type
What to Do Next
Check your HTML and template files. Make sure you are never outputting { ... } code blocks directly in HTML.
Use <script src="..."></script> to include JavaScript.
If you are using a framework, ensure you’re not accidentally outputting JS code in your templates.
If you share your HTML file (or th
