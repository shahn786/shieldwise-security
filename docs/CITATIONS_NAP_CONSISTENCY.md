## Building Local Authority for ShieldWise Security

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** Documentation for deployment phase

---

## Overview

Citations are online mentions of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP). They are a **critical local SEO ranking factor** for appearing in Google's Local Pack and improving organic rankings.

**Goal:** Consistent NAP across 50+ authoritative directories within first 3 months.

---

## Part 1: NAP Consistency - The Foundation

### The Golden Rule: 100% Consistency

Your business information must be **identical** across all platforms:

**Standard NAP Format:**
```
Business Name: ShieldWise Security
Address: 220 Soo Dr, Fullerton, CA 92832
Phone: (714) 716-7430
Website: https://shieldwisesecurity.com
Email: info@shieldwisesecurity.com
```

**Critical Rules:**
- ✅ Use **(714) 716-7430** not **714-716-7430** or **714.716.7430**
- ✅ Use **220 Soo Dr** not **220 Soo Drive** or **220 Soo Dr.** (with period)
- ✅ Use **Fullerton, CA 92832** not **Fullerton, California 92832**
- ✅ Always include suite/unit number if applicable
- ✅ Use **ShieldWise Security** not **Shieldwise Security** or **Shield Wise Security**

**Why Consistency Matters:**
- Google uses NAP to verify business legitimacy
- Inconsistent NAP confuses search engines
- Can hurt local rankings significantly
- May create duplicate business listings
